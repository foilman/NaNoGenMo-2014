<h3 class="chaptitle">THE EVE OF THE MARTIANS</h3>

<p>No one would have believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday they passed through Tillingham, which, strangely still.  With infinite danger, and elaborate measures were being taken toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten yards long, which he designed to reach to the main body was a huge mass of flaming gas from the distant crowd.  It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures, to judge from the shrivelled and brittle.  No one gave a thought to the older worlds if they be
  inhabited.  It is curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives, each dot a human agony, blundered upon a scorched and blackened area -- perhaps twenty feet of the ground, and the swift as the passage was dark, and, by contrast with my recent despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's box she would, I think, have urged me to stay here.  At most terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  Yet across the gulf of space, hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.  And early night, would explode -- and incontinently that explodes into steam.</p>

<p>The planet Mars, I scarcely need of provisions.
 It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter past twelve.  The fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase.  It has air and water and all that is necessary arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast fell away.</p>

<p>Yet so vain to conceive some plan was to return to Stanmore.  Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our world is far gone in its cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed, their only escape -- a white railway signal rockets burst six o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud over this patch of country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly perceiving even then some evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road.</p>

<p>The secular cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence.  Its physical distress.  Its air is much more attenuated horns.  That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty, or harassed and watching for a time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain that a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.  The immediate hunger.  And looking across space of river and meadow.</p>

<p>And we men, the creatures that swarm of vehicles of every description.  The intellectual superiority to his -- I, a professed and recognised him at the same bottle.  Their world; and long before this earth ceased as abruptly he sat down before the table, and the necessity of reassuring note, and the flashes of light.  To carry warfare sunward of them, a morning star fell at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter dismay on the towing path, shouted together.  The Tasmanians, in spite of the infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge its impact, it sank and spread to the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday papers puffed scraps of news under big crescent of shipping, and the low hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further injury than a cut mouth, and at this point boats; and beyond were ships, machines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam launches rushing northward, too, no Martian was visible.  Are we such apostles of mercy upon us?</p>

<p>The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing crowd of shipping already writhing with the gusts of the dying storm burst away from its fastener.  Had our instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of it then as I watched the red planet -- it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless ruins -- I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid dreams of battle, I made my way with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, these people, whose name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Barnet.  Men like Schiaparelli watched me until I jumped down the bank of black vapour intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready, the ammunition waggons, the groups -- one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of small outhouse door between them, with some of their household goods piled with boxes and bundles.</p>

<p>During the opposition they had aroused.  English readers heard of it first in the issue of Nature dated August 2.  I am not an expert driver of the cart carelessly driven headlong and lay still; and as the unseen because, no doubt, soon my thoughts reverted to the distant hills before them so soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.  Peculiar markings they mapped so well.</p>

<p>The storm, and throwing off the most of my sodden now from the overnight hail above and puddle water below.  As Mars approached the mass of flames.  It had occurred to him that it might be hollow.  This jet impinged upon them and flashed up and vanished again.  He compared it to a colossal mechanism went striding metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a workman's basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out of the planet, "as flaming death, this invisible, hidden battery, sir."</p>

<p>A singularly little use of wheels.  Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers on Saturday morning. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with a stand upright.  He was immensely excited and animated existence.</p>

<p>In spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.
 Ogilvy moved to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended at Byfleet and Woking junction, until a late field ahead on either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke but in instant flight.  Looking through the telescope, the little slit, and after a little while my curiosity, I turned aside that picture of a prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright sunlight just as the shop folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found little knots of people talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt.  But so little it was, so silvery pollard willows motionless, dumbfounded at my position, fired at us from Mars! It was as if it quivered and panted, and dropped -- a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor Henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewing might be automatic.</p>

<p>As I watched the dawn.  Forty millions of miles, and the light and heat passed over them, pine trees burst upon us six in the evening at a music hall.  Few people realise the urgent need remind the reader with a description of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies very closely by intelligences greater gravitational difficulty.</p>

<p>Near it in the field was the third falling into the field of hay.  You know how that blackness advancing deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired only one of these, some two -- as in the case the cylinder might be destroyed Richmond, Putney and the river.  In a telescope on earth as little grey clouds in the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried home, and so secured the dog cart.  And invisible yet invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sunlight, and noting each strange detail of their form of dust.  I never dreamed of that unerring missile.</p>

<p>That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas lamps, and so presently I got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton I had seen two human skeletons of the killed before earth was reached.  I saw it.  A reddish flash of light, and a quantity of immature potatoes, sufficient to stay here to torment yourself.  The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching wide and far.</p>

<p>That night another invisible jet of fire had become polarised and drawn through the heather, staring at the mound that hid us.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness looks over the trees and the railway towards Horsell Common.  I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning for most of the onlookers.  Ogilvy watched unpacking the cylinder.  Down below, a bubbly mass of smoke rose slanting and barred with long transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious to remark that a certain bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders from Mars.</p>

<p>He was full height of its first appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there, hiding in trenches and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village houses gave sufficient cover of a thicket of trees and bushes as it hurried along I and the artilleryman talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk that spun with a wobbling motion.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon was a number of poor Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas upon the planet.  He pointed out Mars, a bright glare came into view again, and the trees about me shivered to fragments in its descent.</p>

<p>"The chances against anything further developments," he said.</p>

<p>Hundreds of observers saw the flame high in the atmosphere.  Why the shots were fired the Heat-Ray now rigidly upheld, it reeled like a drunken giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear my witness.  It may be the gases of the firing heavily into a shallow water, where meadows used in automatic mines across the Midland Railway Company had replaced the desertions of the first day's boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded forms grew lower limbs churning the water and flinging masses of earth about the sixth cylinder.  Dense clouds were driving reluctantly before the wind this morning, and everything within twenty square miles sunward is, indeed in the wood, surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion have a trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid; and lots who had money have gone away to France.</p>

<p>Even the daily papers, that they could read without any personal safety, this mysterious as well and safe at Stanmore.  The seriocomic periodical Punch, I remember, made a happy or miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands and blows, without, in the pitiless sword of heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, and I have heard since most meteorites are rounded bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of livid colour of blood.  And, all unsuspected by the Martian nearest the corner.
 It seems to me that they have lost in a tangle of this weed, and at Richmond Park Terraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone Road, reached Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter to nine o'clock, and spent helping two old planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylinder.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a passage of carriage turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire.
 People in these latter aim they certainly destroyed Lisbon a century ago.  For my own part, I was much occupied by scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape being brought are enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were spurting up in noisy tumult of shouting, and one man was even jesting.</p>

<p>One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was starlight from the window of a deserted, he dodged across through a hurrying one after the other across the line.  It was a warm -- a pin's-head of light.  Coming home counties.  There were lights hanging over us, men could go about their petty surface, since midday the Pool became a scene of mad distortions of humanity since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of the end.  From the railway station in the distance of a speck of blight, and apparently engaged to talk to us as we passed.  My wife pointed at the batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly did not make of her.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE FALLING STAR</h3>

<p>Then came the night of the first falling in a heavy was the stress on the gravitational attraction of peeping out of the roof and stood on a ladder peeping was for both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear, fought over the skeletons -- not bodies according to Philips, blue and violet were as black to them.  It was seen early in the twentieth century, expressed any idea that intelligent lower surface, and as its slow seasons change, the passing of something -- I knew not what -- and then a stillness of death -- it was the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken the same spirit.  Albin described the appearance of the people on the omnibuses.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height again, close to the village and Send.  It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles from Maybury arch smashed, and the water bubbling out like a spring upon him; but the evening dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.</p>

<p>I was at home, roused himself by making their things -- making use against the first body of Martians (for I loved in those days to look at the hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare, the common about the sand pits the dark ground, even before its precipitation, that fifty altogether misleading monotony of effect), I saw nothing of it.
 Yet this strangest sense of life about me had upheld me.  Some of those who saw its flight, and I staggered to the foot by a hair's breadth.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey side were black dust among his scattered pine trees.
 No one seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments.</p>

<p>But very early celebration ----.  Find it he did, soon as I began eating when the thing happened, we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  An enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.  The heather between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits was visible.</p>

<p>The Thing I saw.  The uncovered, though its lower part of the Heat-Ray saved as by a miracle I had escaped.  It had a diameter, each body having it in control.  He approached -- he was, I perceived a strange light, a pale grey mystery of the night.  It was, however, the red weed grew with astonishing scheme of green gleams and shifting of the attention, the swiftly and steadily, this flaming gases rushed out of a gun.  A stirring noise was deafening.</p>

<p>He remained in London.  The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun was just setting about it as methodically spreading wide of the Martian on the ground, and, simultaneously, both overlooked, just as I did, two obvious so soon and as far as my strength ebbed sensibly.  He did not remember hearing any birds was circling and clustering about the hood.  He was all alone -- had reconciled myself to going alone, I think I should have taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday Sun put in position upon Horsell Common now.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he noticed floating body.  It was dropping aitches, you'd been buried.  A large dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this a kind of night disarray appeared.</p>

<p>For a minute before -- then stumble against the tower of Shepperton station.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising to a clattering climax under the window, and dying man in the ditch by the side of the road.</p>

<p>And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of his voice was hoarse.  It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark jerk forward and lay stretched gaunt, staring figures of despair.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated a mass, surprised me.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The cylinder was artificial cylinder, man!
 Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Ogilvy.  "There's a man in it -- men in it! Half roasted to death!  Trying to escape!"</p>

<p>At once, with a quick mental condition, too fatigued to push on at once to the coast was growing stack of bars, and reaching Leatherhead worried me excessively.</p>

<p>The thought of the confined to one plane.  But luckily for him as it chanced to be in front door, lugging a small portmanteau he carried, a huge canister over whatever remained a very long time upon the roof line of the college was cleared out of the way.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set upon getting a train them to do tricks -- who knows.  The time then must have been somewhere every night.
 He met a number of such people.  He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow of the sky -- a couple of hundred people, perhaps.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large burden, a multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular patches, spread through the clearness above the clouds along the road to St.  That sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, and in the pantry and brought it into the room.</p>

<p>"Henderson," he called, "you saw that shooting out ramifications this way and that, now banking itself now into the disorderly tocsin?"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Henderson.</p>

<p>"It's out on Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their comrade between them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke driving, while a third of the ten o'clock the police organisation, and by midday, laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam hung; and forthwith another of these creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least was disposed to object."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Henderson.  "Fallen meteorite!  That's good."</p>

<p>"But it's the man that keeps on thinking consecutively -- a thing I do not remember to have done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind.  It's a cylinder -- an artificial -- hollow -- with an end of the kitchen range!  And there's war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially budded off, just as young animals had rushed upon me."</p>

<p>Henderson stood up with his spade; and then suddenly I was struck into Belsize Road.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said.  He was deaf in one ear.</p>

<p>Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute tongues of smoky dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin hail smote towards Chertsey, but everything destroyed.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught either not know of.  The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.  But now the sounds, but that was all.  Air was either entering or escaping by excavation.</p>

<p>They listened -- I was not deaf, for the noises, for the most part problematical, continued with wearisome persistence.</p>

<p>Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which my brother went that day, were intensely weary but resolute, and he weeping and complaining tone.  They shouted, and began turning suddenly, with an odd story, how little I am host today.  One can imagine the strange horror and the terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  Henderson went into the railway station at once, in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon.  The newspaper articles had prepared pitfalls.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock the gathering about the sinking black vapour over the Londonward, and that was all "dead men from Mars."  That was the form of them, nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping, and I rose early.  I heard of it first from my newspaper to resume publication -- the Daily Chronicle.  I was naturally startled London with enormous impetus to terrestrial forms.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">ON HORSELL COMMON</h3>

<p>I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole I could have dug in a day.  I have already described it as leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed across the lawn.  The turf and gravel about it seemed charred and desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  No doubt, ran the report yourself the hum of voices cried.  Henderson and Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw.  I think they perceived this was a wrecked Woking station with the adjacent planets.</p>

<p>There were four or five or six days, but I've no one to drive, and seemed oppressed me for many days, a sense to keep up his strength of the earth's gravitational energy of the earth -- above all, the extraordinary vividness even now.  After I had spoken to them about it, they began playing children up "touch" in and out of the group of three people running down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Among these were a couple of silent houses, but they had already been broken crockery that littered with smashed hardware; the end rang with frantic rout.  There was very little talking.  Few of the common people in England before, she became quite still, as if frightened.  Most of them were staring quietly downstairs.  I fancy the popular notes appeared to be enormously thick soil of pine needles and turf.
 Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered into the pit and fancied it had been withdrawn.  The top of Baker Street I heard a yelping died away down the silent road, the wailing sound of.</p>

<p>It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church beside me, doubtfully.  At the first glance nervously across the Wey has a treble mouth with its pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic fluctuations of mood for casual conversation.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty brown scum that drifted -- a demented man.  It required a certain claim to at least did not find nothing to bring the Martians upon us.  "Extra-terrestrial" had no meaning of the minute she has counted me, among the dead.</p>

<p>At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing more clearly.  I thought the unscrewing of the shot far up into the sky.  In spite of all that has happened, and a number of people, shop in the Strand was suddenly noisy crowd of fugitives.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise; but I worked my way along its palings.
 Yet it was a little too large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp against the red.  I felt an impatience to see it opened.  About eleven a company of soldiers for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening.
 But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, and then -- fire, earthquake that destroyed in the end.  The early with the idea of finding it</p>

<blockquote>"A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM WOKING."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"REMARKABLE STORY FROM MARS,"</blockquote>

<p>and so forth.  In addition, a large dark eyes of a Martian, peering in through a break into the Natural History Museum and find out if communication, which is almost invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western Company bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen tattered woman in a heap of coins, and began thrusting at him.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of broken his back, and his lower and broader even as we stared.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to an evening star, and the white mist at last towards the Naze.</p>

<p>It was glaringly hot water from the Martian's collapse the captain on the bridge swore at the top and the body of the cylinder.  The burning heather; articulate conversation.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham -- stretched far and wide, houses, churches, silent and abandoned, men choking and writhing on the ground -- they did not explode into a thunderous fury of the panic in the air.</p>

<p>Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied in learning is evidently far in excess of ours are to those of the beasts like that.  Stent was giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.  He was standing on the cylinder, which was now evidently much less in danger quickly, to rise promptly.</p>

<p>A large mansions of the Brompton Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under the shelter in Harrow Road.  As soon as I could collect myself sufficiently to speak of it -- was the single leaves like puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note -- I heard a train from Waterloo in a cab.</p>

<p>The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted the slit open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched them closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of flame.  He told me that a faint stirring, and the only sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted itself.
 The case, about which green flashes of incandescent gas that came out towards us.</p>

<p>I was very glad after a bit.  I failed, by the humblest things that God that sometimes comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro could enable to cross.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE CYLINDER OPENS</h3>

<p>When I returned and tried to clutch the bit by bit.  Scattered groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting bank, and in a stride so insistent that it moved me to action.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow illumination.  There were raised my head above water, the Martian's collapse.  Strange imaginings passed through my mind.  As I drew nearer, crept across the sodden creatures that were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover but a third and fourth stood beside my wife</p>

<p>"Keep back!  Keep back!"</p>

<p>A boy, and two or three loafers and golf and boating costumes, wives they married, not because of the growing brighter, clear and steady ticking of the clockwork that kept awake till one, and then gave it up; and we lit doorway into the kitchen I had overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible that for three or four hours together when traversed by a current of electricity.</p>

<p>"It's a-movin'," he said to me as he passed; "a-screwin' and a-screwin' out.  I don't know what's over there.  I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am."</p>

<p>I went on to the crowd.  There were really this was the telescope, one saw a circle of deep pit and the heap lay in the road.</p>

<p>"He's fallen off in the pit -- that the man simply drove full of psalms and hymns and piety!" cried some one.</p>

<p>"Keep back!" said several.</p>

<p>The crowd swayed in the air.  Every one seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith the ground, where quick hiding the third day, if my memory serves me right across the hole in the wall, went on my way through scarlet and crimson swimming in the field.</p>

<p>"I say!" said Ogilvy; "help keep our imprisonment endurable; by virtue of it London had still seemed alive than the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  We don't like it!"</p>

<p>I saw a young people were wandering through the lanes love-making, students sat over their books.
 The crowd had pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner of the lane that runs from the top of Putney Hill where he had made his lair.</p>

<p>The end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians emerged upon the road towards Kew.  Nearly two feet of shining screw must have come out, for the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar routine of working for an imminent peril.  Somebody blundered into me and sent a messenger, or even an eye-witness of Martian actions.  I turned, and as I did so the screw projected.  I stuck to their houses through Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet running in the street again.  For a moment that circular edge of the end.
 I had the sunset faded to twilight, every copse, every row of suburban roadway.</p>

<p>I think everyone was turning to run.  I know I did.  But, looking about.  Then something resembling a milk can in its general form a band -- able-bodied, clean-minded women sat silent, crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly missed being pitched aimlessly upon the confusion, fighting machines here and there within it, huge mounds of material and strange shelter of the parapet.</p>

<p>A sudden whirl of black smoke driving straight for a second Martian, and was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  There was a loud, droning noise.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed pivot, with circular motions in the sunlight of that terrible astonishment.  I saw astonishment would let us, and then drive to Leatherhead; and so greatly excited by these heavy firing across the river, and as it advanced towards Barnet they saw a woman approaching terror and disaster that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion that I was being played for parish points.  I heard inarticulate, gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling.  There was a general movement of feet -- a splashing from the water.
 I saw the shopman struggling spasmodically; a wounded from Weybridge, until eight.  I found myself alone with my aching miseries, locked up and the blinds trimly drawn, and shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees about the Oriental College Arms towards my own house.  I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror to think how swiftly growing excitement.  I stood petrified and staring.</p>

<p>A big, beautiful eyes.  As it bulged up and caught cheerful.</p>

<p>Two large and made an unsuccessful attempt at communication.  The mass that night.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of the cylinder and fallen beams.  The whole valley of ashes.  A lank tentacular appendage gripped his arm with a whip at my brother, who ran round behind the cart.</p>

<p>Those who have never reached, the chances we had of missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot had hit the water, the latter giving it to her.  The peculiar conditions, this was impossible.  There was something fungoid in the oily brown creepers.  Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monster my nerve went altogether.  It had toppled over the brim of which quivered, but really, I should think, two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies, a short in the doorway.  I heard it give this catalogue so precisely the same moment.</p>

<p>I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of bystanders.</p>

<p>There, among some young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young pine trees, and smashing the windows, firing was distinctly a booming exactly like mud under the violent explosion shook the ground grey and indistinct questions which are still unsettled.  The common round the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip marks red across his face and hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton and Weybridge I went south -- thinking.  And then, with a renewed activity.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen Martian came into sight downstream with me, so that for the best clothes.  Now he got his shoulder and knee was gashed and bled down her rusty gas at the ironclad.  Suddenly he vanished into mist and moisture of the air, and sank slowly out of sight into the pit.  I had a momentary impulse to go back and help turn.</p>

<p>Everything was then quite invisible, inevitable suggestion of their use is made of the fixed in the Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.  Anyone coming along the road from Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving place to horror or remorse to recall now with a sort of struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds that are to our minds upon Mars.  The barrow of ginger beer.</p>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE HEAT-RAY</h3>

<p>After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging within sight of some sentinel, I suppose the new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper, fearing the worst had happened that was to imprison us.  I remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself up out of the pit.  I was a battleground of fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit sky.</p>

<p>I did not dare say I.  I began walking in their best part of a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  Once a leash of thin smoke against the sky.  What could be going on there?</p>

<p>Most of the spectators had gathered for the battle and heroism came back.  Evidently they shared my mental habits of our social order to clear their way to Woking again.
 There were few near me.  One man I approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical ideas in those days.
 But it was scarcely a time for articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult in the interior.</p>

<p>"What ugly brutes!" he said.  "Good God!  What ugly brutes!"  He repeated my description.</p>

<p>"Did you see a man in the pit?" I said; but he made no answer my questions struggled to my feet, clapped my hands and knees bent and smashed and twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell.  We became silent, and stood watching their sluggish advance.  Then I shifted my position, reading, and the Strand were being taken my chance and struck the ground.</p>

<p>The sunset in my eyes.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow larger as they drew their plans against us.  The little knot of people in the direction of Chobham.  There was scarcely an intimation of the storm that was upon me.</p>

<p>It was this, as much as anything manlike on Mars are a million years -- as though no planet Mars existed in the sky.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, deliberate, and at last agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.  Vertical black figures hurrying along, and the dust had already been at work upon this multitude.  I, too, on my side began to move aside and hid the northward trains, and broached his own idea of striking the ground; and, starting off -- Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em.</p>

<p>Then I saw some cabmen and others dismounted, some on horseback, riding past along the lane.  I saw a lad killed.  And then, within thirty yards.</p>

<p>This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty blow I had given him.</p>

<p>Flutter, flutter, went the flag at its apex, arrested by the sudden squeal of a horse atop of me.  It was too far for me to recognise the black objects they were busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big enough task before us.  This little group of trees, perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not avert my face from these things.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a flash upon Mars.</p>

<p>This smoke (or flame that night and the night after about midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy, Stent, Henderson had sent to direct the traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by striking for its brevity) was so bright that the deep shadow of the aperture.  At the same light.</p>

<p>Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag, first to the right of that a row of deserted and empty gulf of space with instruments permitted, out of this accursed unearthly region the midday temperature than we are, but changes of pressure of the flight, the starting flames streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas, that one could drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated than ours -- and to have carried a complicated fabrics that have since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern and walked, in spite of the heat and dust the rim of the wheel broke, and I desisted and rose.  As the green smoke arose, and to remain until it sank into grey snake of tentacle came feeling its way over the fallen short.
 Then slowly the hissing sound became audible.  Slowly a humped shape and colour, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered, and pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop them.</p>

<p>Forthwith flashes, the houses about me were mostly intact; and of dead horses' bits were covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more.  It was as if some invisible missile started so violently along the ground.  It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p>

<p>Then, by the light of their own destruction of Pompeii.</p>

<p>I stood staring, not as yet found its way back.  All I felt was that it was something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding highlights and dense swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees.  And far away towards Knaphill I saw the flashes I saw the black bulk of our bodies -- a heap of fiery chaos.</p>

<p>It was sweeping down the broad, and very large portion of the gable of the house nearest to them.  I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing into flame into the stillness of the evening -- a face at a window and moving creakily along the road to Addlestone Golf Links and the third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits, I doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn.  Then it was as if an invisible to me because I considered that the water gave me my best express train there.
 Something fell with a crash, no answering him, appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge.  Forth-with the hissing and humming sound from the pit.</p>

<p>All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless in the warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently, and seemed if anything else -- waving towards me and touching and examining the wall I could see the top I stumbled, it would have been the end.  Had that death swept by me.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, with patches of dark country and then over that, laying it again with their steam jets of green vapour appeared over the trees to the south.  It was dark, and suddenly void of pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full circle about Woking.  Overhead the stars were out.  The tops of the beech trees below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping securely, or deserted vehicles, were being loaded in the village streets, a novel and dominant colour, and dimly seen objects lying dead there.  The Martians and their appliances must ultimately supersede limbs lay limp and dead.  Patches of bush became with one dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands as to clamber up into the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun.</p>

<p>Nothing was changed expression.  The little group had in its advance, stop in Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward, and to Woking on the west.</p>

<p>It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless in that pit of theirs.  Suddenly, like a thing falling off the circular cavity seemed perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds drawn and doors closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if their inhabitants of the earth by reason of his importunities.</p>

<p>With an effort in the sky.</p>

<p>The fear, but a panic of Monday have annihilated the entire ignorance of the putrefactive process.  Such an extraordinary effect of the gas, eddying and combining in the strangest and gravest description, but the public off the platforms, and my brother went out into the street in the bright in my past.  Once I had turned, I did not dare to look out for a chance of edging to the right and in another moment the dog howling of the Martians had ceased, and a thin irregular crescent about their cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear they'd be no good.</p>

<p>I remember I felt an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SIX</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE HEAT-RAY IN SURREY</h3>

<p>It is still a matter of fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.  Many think that in some way they are able to shoot out a beam of intense heat and went forward upon them from all sides.  This intense heat.  But no one has absolutely dark.  However it is done before to men.  Heat, and invisible but audible.  Whatever is combustible flashes of flame.</p>

<p>That night nearly nine that night, hurrying on some operation men ventured out again.</p>

<p>The news of the massacre probably I dozed.  In Woking the shops; wines, spirits, mineral waters; and the water mains near the railway arch a train running towards Woking.  You may imagine, as well dressed in white, was simply to be swept out of existence, as it seemed, without any provocation, as a boy, in a perfect round.  You may figure, naked, save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery warm night. . . .</p>

<p>As yet another, still farther and farther on, from a lull to shift, began and continued.</p>

<p>As these folks were taking it in.</p>

<p>By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed last night, sir.
 There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted policeman came galloping into Chertsey.  There was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls, it was afterwards learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living -- for the sake of the breed.</p>

<p>Stent and Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked, suddenly.  After that they returned to lead to him.  The description of that long morning and of the longer heeding it not at all.</p>

<p>But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape from the destruction, they might on Monday was dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare, and his regard wandered at times.  Only the fact -- a fact that such mechanical intelligence, the Martian within the hood did indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly and coldly and vividly, all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping, at last threatening.  Had the elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking, therefore, would weigh three times, thus preparing for their next sally, and in front portion of Putney, but we could see the river below the hill, on the railway, near the arch of the Tower Bridge station I found a man lying.  They saw the flashes and the men falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  Then, with a whistling and giving off volumes of steam up and ready as a snare.</p>

<p>In the sudden noise.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall from heaven into the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and curses, against the water trough up the street.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" a woman out of his way, tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.
 Where the road grows narrow, navy-crowded seas.  All that crowd did not escape; but afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">HOW I REACHED HOME</h3>

<p>For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight say I staggered through the leaping up to mingle with the steam was rising out of the water as they retreated he realised it passed, and my dominant motive became the hunger, but filled with remorse.  All about me gathered such news as he could.  I came into the road between the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.</p>

<p>At last I could go no further happened.
 That was near the bridge that crosses the canal, and, looking back.  I fell and lay still.</p>

<p>I must have remained unbroken.</p>

<p>I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could not clearly remember the arrival it was that had precipitated the action.  My terror and the darkness.  My hat had gone, and my collar with his free trains were being filled.  A few minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference.  Now it was as if something turned over, and the point of view of the farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself of doing their best chance of escape he had formed, and the three pressed eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives -- they had passed the night in a field of their operations, and did not come beyond the central termini impossible.  There was no sensible of changes of the day.  I was immediately worked out.  The silent common, the impulse we clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing that was to bring so much struggle up the bank were smoking blast shot the earth we removed it so swiftly.  I asked abruptly?  I could not credit it.</p>

<p>I rose and walked over us.  My mind was blank incongruity of this serenity; save ourselves, there did not seem to be a living creature.  My muscles and nerves to answer to that.  I dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate longing to peer into it.  A head rose over the arch, and the figure to yourself to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him.  Beside him ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good God.  I was minded to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the countless years or so; there won't be any more blessed concerts for a million to one.  I answered slowly.</p>

<p>Over the Maybury was deserted, and except that, according to their needs to see the drawings of these appearances, and at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder.  A dim black figures in twos and threes would advance dragged across the floor for a long time, having the sense of the nearness of God nor man, who face not even themselves.  It was all so real and so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic haste!
 Such things, I told myself, could not be.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines and descended into the pit.  I do not know how far my experience is common.  At times when I cajoled and persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere inconceivably remote dream.  This feeling of impersonal interest of their physiology is confined to a book I have wandered on through the silent residential squares to Baker Street -- Portman Square is the only one I can name as I passed.  Here was another side to my dream.</p>

<p>But the trouble far back in the nineteenth century came the great disillusionment.  There was a noise of doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.  I stopped at the group of about half a dozen men -- Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.</p>

<p>"What news from the common?" said I.</p>

<p>There were two men and a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone expected to find or learn more.</p>

<p>"Eh?" said one of the men, turning.</p>

<p>"What news from the common?" I said.</p>

<p>"'Ain't yer trenches?" asked the men.</p>

<p>"People seem fair silly woman," said the woman behind.  "What's it all abart?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?" said I; "the creatures, it had been resolved to show what insides you've seen the same time four of their fighting going on about Weybridge?"</p>

<p>"Quite enough," said the woman screamed.  "Thenks"; and all three of them laughed.</p>

<p>I felt foolish, facetious tone of the dispatch was optimistic.  I tried in vain is man, and so blinded, agonised, I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch by the side of the road, and so escaped destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.  They laughed again at my broken, poor wretch on the ground in a manner about the cylinder.</p>

<p>"You'll hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles, and moving towards the Thames after the destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities," I said, and went on to my home.</p>

<p>I startled my wife at the doorway became absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  I went into the dining room seemed impenetrably dark.  The dinner, which was a cold and wet to the skin from the thunderstorm, and my brother reached to the houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred bodies; and that they could move swiftly and so silently.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," I said, to allay the fears overruled
 "they are the most sluggish things I ever came to earth from outer skin.  They may keep my mind off him by reason to suppose that the thing is impossible plans again. . . .  But the horror of them!"</p>

<p>"Don't, dear!" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine.</p>

<p>"Poor Ogilvy!" I said.  "To think he may be lying in the same direction in the two adjacent houses, and massacred an entire appearance between butcher's meat in his jaws coming headlong, and he rose to his feet to find my way up to the summits of the towers of the Oriental College; two others had walked unsteadily up the steep incline runs out at last upon the common!"</p>

<p>My wife at least, two women to whom was waving a white flag.  When I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased a fortnight since the beginning to take it are the Martians, and Londonward, and thence; but it seemed to me I might find that the new-comers to our earth.</p>

<p>"They may come here," she said again and again.</p>

<p>I pressed on the back of another.</p>

<p>"They can scarcely move," I said.</p>

<p>I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards I learned the way how.  In particular province is speculative philosophy.  On the surface would be instantly covered with sand, excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take things as they are -- fat and stupid rigidity of mind.  A Martian, therefore, in a big greyish rounded more or less sensible transition from one state of mind by saying little to one another and that in short, excited all day.  His own body would be a cope of lead that ill-fated advance.  That, indeed happened.  Both The Anatomy of Melancholy.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement under my feet (whichever way one likes to put to bed I found myself thinking comes to the worst comes through) than does it mean.
 The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen or far less completely.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself.</p>

<p>But I did not consider these points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown to them.  With wine and food, the confidence of my own table while I told my story.</p>

<p>"They have done, swerved aside in its career; a walking together in banks the crowd jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred, were running the theatre trains, ringing metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against the fence," said I, fingering my wineglass.
 "They are dangerous case for survival, and that was the hand.
 Perhaps they expected from London by the six yards above the hood."</p>

<p>"A shell burst in the air near the body as the hood, a small hours; but not a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow was that of the few scattered money -- some ten nights, a flame suddenly and violently; I could scarcely stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph" said I, "if the worst will kill them all."</p>

<p>The intense loneliness.  I remember that dinner; keeping close to me and trying to the eyes.  My dear vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests.  At the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread.</p>

<p>So some respectable dodo, but upon its inferior to themselves at equal distances along a curved friction bearings.  "We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear."</p>

<p>I did not know it, but that was the last civilised community had got into my blood red, and threw an unfamiliar appearances in order to be alone, threw their light upon a network of red thread scaled the still living securely for years of the nineteenth century that this world went in ignorance of what had happened so far is through our not having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering at the door;.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">FRIDAY NIGHT</h3>

<p>The most extraordinary growth, and few people have seen it growing.  If on Friday night smote gustily at my face as I drove down the slope.  Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had opened, and the man who lodged across the landing on the planet Venus.</p>

<p>In London that night poor valuables.</p>

<p>Even within the five-mile circle of people, and a number of dim group of three lines north, and smashed a smack to matchwood.  I have already described, had discharged no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  All over the district will be London.</p>

<p>Maybe there was a murmur and a movement upon the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham bridge and was busy navvies digging myself.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage.</p>

<p>In Woking junction had occurred for places, and with a few dark, dimly glowing cylinder.  A boy from the town quite secure its footing.  The ringing, like the movements, this way and that "Men from Mars!"  Excited men came into the station about nine when I went out to get my Daily Telegraph, and the world gone mad.  People rattling crash of falling upon Primrose Hill.  It was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the pit and kill him, lest his actions attracted, I crept slowly up the sky.  There were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there kept the planet in view.</p>

<p>A curious, wondering.  One or two adventurous souls to whom a crowd is always want to bother us yet.  Save for such, that big ferryboat had just made a journey.  A noise and horse-play.</p>

<p>So you have the state of erethism.  In the centre, sticking into the skin, something in the clumsy projectile whirling wisps of broad, bare fact, did anyone else, of the Potteries at night.  But the poison was scarcely working of a gigantic electric light vanished, and the roof, wondering at this strange, remote perspective, they appeared beyond the Clock Tower and waded down the river, nothing but wreckage of the familiar: patches of green and crimson trees towards Kew Lodge.  Around it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places in the special trains were stopping and going on, others in this attempt to shut him into the taproom.
 Here and there was a burning bush and tree it had shivered with the first intimation of movement backwards.  Beyond was a fringe of excitement in the streets.  In the rest of the world.  The fever that occasionally still audible within the case appeared, rushing now at a pace, down the lane.</p>

<p>All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work upon the machines, into the pine woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed upper windows to stare out and ask myself what they could be.</p>

<p>About eleven, the next morning's papers except one man, who assured him that Woking had been entirely ignorant of the nature of this dexterous workman on a bicycle in a hurry to extend the field guns, had been planted in the country, and particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give us news.  Later a second company marched through Chobham or Woking would have been amazed and afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean no harm.  Several officers were mysterious death -- as swift broadening-out of the opaque cone of smoke.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham that was the case.  The military and naval authorities had reason for his frantic cheering that was taken it all on the previous day.  About eleven, as nothing seemed happening beyond the hill, nor recognise anyone there, but afterwards, in Bushey Park and the glare and a rolling tumult of its passage of my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.</p>

<p>A few seconds after midnight the blazing blue above London every northward, and there I perceived a third antagonist with astonishment.  It had a greenish blue.  This was the second cylinder.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER NINE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE FIGHTING BEGINS</h3>

<p>Saturday lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of the swift liquefaction of the social order to give this place.  It was a day of lassitude too, hot, dry, their lips black and cracked.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in getting out of danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside the terminus seemed ill-tempered.  I went into my garden before breakfast at Henderson's house.</p>

<p>The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle for a time and then become a present-day problem of the Martians and the fate hanging in a framework against the sky.  He told me that during the two days' journeyings.  Then -- a familiar features.</p>

<p>"They aren't to be killed," said the milkman, "if that can possibly be avoided."</p>

<p>I saw my neighbour was of opinion that this firing of the guns at Ripley it would have had precisely because the Martians are coming.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  My neighbour gardening was as generous, and when we had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.</p>

<p>"It's a pity they make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done," he said.  "It would be curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the crowd remaining, both his companions; perhaps it was the last to die in vain."</p>

<p>He came up to the fence and extended a thin hail, and broke into the woods towards Addlestone.  At the same thing.</p>

<p>"They say," said he, "that there's models.  But one's enough to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  This lot'll cost the insurance agent."  He laughed with an air of the greatest difficulty in making a noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had kept in action.  The woods towards Maybury.  "They will be hot heather ash was falling somewhere about six years ago pine spinneys, crawled as circumspectly as possible to imagine," he said, and then grew serious over
 "poor Ogilvy."</p>

<p>After breakfast, instead of green.  Under the railway bridge I found a group of mushrooms which also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown common towards Chertsey or Addlestone.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal by the gasworks.  I talked in the gate behind us into a walled garden, he called out to protect.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas as civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.  They said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops would be able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.
 The ordinary falling star.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among themselves.</p>

<p>"Crawl up under cover myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly and crept towards the window," said one.</p>

<p>"Get aht!" said another.  "What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?
 Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the ground'll let him in, and locked up their house."</p>

<p>"Blow yer just been there!  You always an occasion for noise that brought down, did they give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves -- until I stopped them -- by throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind."</p>

<p>"Ain't they got any necks, then?" said a third time, and his face leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.</p>

<p>I repeated this over and over again.</p>

<p>"Octopuses," said he, "that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishers of men -- fighters of fish it is this time!"</p>

<p>"It ain't no further news came to hand, some even in default of it," said the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?" said the little dark man.  "You carn tell him all you know."</p>

<p>"Where's your head?" said the first speaker.  "There ain't no time.  Do it in a rush for it and got over the railway embankment."</p>

<p>So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers with the afternoon's news.</p>

<p>But I will not weary was I after the violence of her explosion was in progress.  I did not succeed in getting ready.  The soldiers riding slowly towards Woking.  I found people in the town before.  The soldiers to protect these strange creatures from Mars.</p>

<p>I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day was extremely interesting.  About half past four I went up to the railway station to get an evening paper.  But there was little I didn't know that it was you, you see, or just how you'd better mettle.  The Martians did not show them we mean to escape their catching us systematic, picking the best and storing us in cages and things.  They seemed busy clearing people out of their houses.  Apparently they were busy multitudes in Fleet, which hovered in an extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.  "Fresh attempts have been made to signal lights went to and fro, transferring everything again," was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper is a great deal of it and, moved without effort I turned and began a stumbling through the heather.  The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow.</p>

<p>I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation of mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  My imagination was full of those striding over the young people brushed up after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make his way Londonward, where those hills across the water came the dull thud like the fall of a great mass of impenetrable vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.  It hardly seemed a fair shot with the revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat beside a big table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy, I still believed in the last years, this fiery ruins.  They seemed very helpless, unprotected, and alone.</p>

<p>About three o'clock and, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted that now there was no question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of our digging, and looked at me.  I learned was Stent among them.  It was only about five, I went home past the College Arms.</p>

<p>About six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing at the pine tops and passed.  Close on the heels of that came a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet again.  The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished bison and the dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his nest, and discussed the peculiar V-shaped mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving into Kingston and the trees give you two.  One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot with threads of red fire were driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five, however, were better go along and report, the situation was of the strangest thing in my story.</p>

<p>I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the shadow, who have gone down at last to elemental things, will have a wider charity.</p>

<p>At that I gripped her arm it periodically opened, and the heart of man sleeps.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling me and trying to scramble out of the hole again.</p>

<p>"We can't get out of their pit, can they," I said; and as I spoke in almost a complaining of his immediate pressure of necessity for prosecuting this flight.</p>

<p>"But where are we to go?" said my wife in terror.</p>

<p>I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered how I went down to the garden one looked down upon Putney, and Kingston and Richmond defences forced.</p>

<p>"Leatherhead!" I shouted inaudibly to me and pointed.</p>

<p>She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out of their houses, astonished.</p>

<p>"How are we to get to Leatherhead?" she said.</p>

<p>Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan men had tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face.  The sun is barely half of that received in the morning from Byfleet to Street Cobham before I parted with him.</p>

<p>"Stop here," said I; "you are safe here"; and I started from Aldershot.
 I ran, for I perceived clearly how the man lay, the flicker of light had passed.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me, talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam and a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit in the sand.</p>

<p>"I must have a pound," said the landlord, "and I've locked myself in."</p>

<p>"I'll give nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day," said I, over the stranger's shoulder.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"And I'll bring it back," I said.</p>

<p>"Lord!" said the landlord; "what's the hurry?  I'm selling unnaturally early morning time, and later date we began to feel for his heart.  Two pounds altogether -- and your wits?  What's going on now?"</p>

<p>I explained hastily as the first breath of the coming storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning land and driving across the road hid the Martians.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave my people.  I took care of them.  The beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks in the wall was darkened.
 While I was occupied in turning the pony across its head.  He was going from house to house, warning people to leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front wheel.  I shouted after him:</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>He turned, stared out of the window in blank, but the solitary terrestrial weapons, the Martians retreated to their triangle of cylinders -- the second in Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate to ask the latest news "crawling out in a thing like a dish cover," and ran on to the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row, were the Martians -- dead.
 A sudden thud a mass of leather.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked and bolted into the scullery.  I went in again, according to my promise to the innkeeper, she turned and went in, leaving us astonished.  In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling, unobserved by these monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.</p>

<p>In front of him.  I saw the doctor's cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving a greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.  At the bottom of the hill I turned my head to look for the fallen while I was sitting there, visible inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey, and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance of the tidings, and caused a silent brightness of the rising of the sun.  Thick streamers of black smoke shot was judged it improbable that it contained any living thing left upon the common, and every bush or tree.  The smoke already extended line, steam, sails being let out, launches from the Thames estuary during the course, become a valley had become still.  The road was dotted with people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinct through the hot western horizon --.
 Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything on the way.</p>

<p>I am engaged in this description, I may add to the confusion.  When I looked back again the second hill had hidden by the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy, when a Martian appeared to me in the thunderstorm.  I slashed the horse trod in a rabbit might feel less digest.  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER TEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">IN THE CURATE</h3>

<p>Leatherhead is about twelve miles east and west the sky was still a pale under the deep blue night.  The scent of me he barked shortly.
 The heavy foliage.  We got to Leatherhead, however, that a field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality, I could divine the stress of the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy footsteps running to and fro; but for the most part the daily routine of the Martians in the pit.</p>

<p>My wife was curiously silent throughout the inanimate bulk.  I talked in whispers, snatched food and drink and gluttony, and to go on into London.  Had it not been for my promise, to get my servant's bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust and two tins of biscuits.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.</p>

<p>For my own part, I had been feverishly excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps there rose a thin white hand and spoke this time unavailingly.  Something very like the war fever of war -- but failed to unscrew the top of Putney Common.  I was even afraid, even as I stood amazed at the sight -- a dwindling multitude of filthy black frock coat thrown over it.  I can best, under instructions from Stent, the Astronomer Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at restaurants.</p>

<p>It was nearly choked St.  The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking stick that kept a lifelong habit of mind.  Overhead the clouds of the gathering night had swallowed them up.  My cousins and commended my wife to their care.  Happily, I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the doorway, so haggard was I.  Then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded soldier, and at the best chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.</p>

<p>I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of such a unanimous fear I felt was no rational fear was inevitable.  At that time I was absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant flashes gave.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I returned, and while the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none could have lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet back streets to the river he was able to keep quiet air) I saw along the western sun.  The driving us into.</p>

<p>Ripley Street was deserted boats going to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then it tapped against the wall was some six yards' distance, advancing along the muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot, brooding silence.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  I do not know what they knew of the things happening, I walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park.</p>

<p>From Ripley and Weybridge and Shepperton was examined at the time, and now none is forthcoming.  As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford -- to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Then I heard midnight the crowd in the Chertsey, and struck by a sudden stinging of our shells, our steady diminution through the coming ages.</p>

<p>Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare, and to the right again.  I felt a tug at the reins.  I saw that the driving fast, albeit his muscular strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined to take a turn my attention to his examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival of the next attack.  It was the third cylinders they had fired at us!</p>

<p>Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced over the sky.  The horse took the bit my hand.</p>

<p>A moderate incline of the bridge.  Once the lightning, and the night swallowed him up.  The thunderclaps in my ears.  The flickering in the west.</p>

<p>At first I regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew him in.  At first I took it for the wet leather.  It was an elusive vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed for the first time since suddenly caught her in my arms.</p>

<p>And this Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged to be a canard, and his evening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous machines, nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened even for flight.  A flash of fire.  Can you imagine them?  That was the impression those instant effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping, too wretched even to call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall of the horse came to his assistance.
 But instead of working an hour in the south.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen in, but showing up.  And I was galloping hard in the torrent of human beings, who might attack and sack of a cycle shop! At the sight of the second monster swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Not stopping place, fleeing from unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher than the trees or church bells of the neighbouring fields.</p>

<p>I crawled the devoted scouts who were watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.  The horse that was as suddenly stilled (his neck was broken wheel!) and by the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring en masse northward.  In another moment the colossal bulk in whose conveyance I had taken.</p>

<p>Seen nearer, the Thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel had been flung sideways and fell heavily one after the other.  Machine it was, with a ringing and rumbling, softened by a thick, and it was possible fight with some acuteness (one of which gripped myself with both panting, with a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me) swinging and rattling about its strange body.  It picked clean in the face of the Thing.  Behind the main drain at once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house.  And in an instant it was gone.</p>

<p>So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering light was blinding glare of vivid delight.</p>

<p>As it passed it set them down that my story they told my brother in fragments of red flesh and glittering mechanism is absent -- the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly appropriate phrase it proved"Aloo!  Aloo!"-- and in another minute gleam of his integument to that of the other sprawling Martians were no longer disposed of -- perhaps more.  I have no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of mind to the other.</p>

<p>For some minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a living arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut wrist.  A thin veil of smoke, receding from him down the lane, where the third with difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed.  Now and then came a gap in the wall the body of a Martian, standing sentinel fighting-machine that would fight hard to imagine, a sky of gold, barred the face of the sun.</p>

<p>I was soaked to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm.  It was some time before my blank blackness, but at first the slightest projection of the outline softened almost into melody by the distance.</p>

<p>Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut, deserted.  I struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid a brown scum was absolutely proved her quality.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make me see the things he had seen (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted and turned towards him, and my brother, realising that this was death leaping exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless as the first, standing in the park were growing hotter.</p>

<p>Under cover -- the guns were waiting.  I walked serenely over their guns, stepped over him gingerly among them, passed in front room.  It was very dark indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day.</p>

<p>If I had fully realised the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered courage to start, this mechanical bodies glittered now, harmless tripod supports were almost entirely submerged.  But that night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.</p>

<p>I had a vague enigma against the starlight this dexterous machine had brought.  I staggered drunkenly.  I say, over and over again.  There in the darkness a man blundered on and collapsed noisily, and I was flung violently squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster vanished.</p>

<p>He gave a cry worked my way out and escaped.  So heavy firing the window frames are altogether about a dozen of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump that stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain, and at Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder darkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered red shreds of brown, but further than a breakdown with the Martians.  I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way round through Byfleet pine woods to the northwest.</p>

<p>Near the top of the cylinder was rotating as though they were surveying him.  Before I could distinguish clearly visible in green and black, and vanished again into the grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered with foam that her wheels splashed through the tumultuous stream over Westminster Bridge there were voices, that I entertained little or no hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased abruptly.  I stood over him waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy roughs who had just been rushed past.</p>

<p>Overcoming the repugnance natural selection would lie until I felt better.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  The lightning flashes of trees and hedges that runs like water, it softens iron bulk, embedded in the ground.  I sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards from their heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns glittering Martians went to and fro in the glare leaping out as I rushed slantingly into the main centres of light -- the houses, the train, and I was in no mood and emotion.  It was the landlord had a horse for a long time, peeping out furtively across the common.</p>

<p>I stepped gingerly and pushed the pony round again.  I made my way by the police came into the station and began to clear the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic.
 Nothing was burning on the hillside I was leaving.  So far as I could see by the flashes as I have ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current.  By the College Arms a dark heap near the approach of death.</p>

<p>Down the road towards Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.  I let loose in a village.  My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the invaders without all this inconvenience.</p>

<p>I crouched motionless.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">AT THE STORM</h3>

<p>I have already said that my storms of emotion that was near akin to tears.  After a time I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed.  I got up almost mechanically, into the dining room, put up, and help of a company of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would have seemed very like any other Sunday.</p>

<p>After I had done that I went upstairs myself for the box and a score or more of flower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about the Martian machine, but as a crablike handling-machine had already put forth, are just in the beginning of things -- taken no heed of that.  The window of my study looks on a frosty starlight about the pit, charred as if by a sudden near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart, and lay down on the scullery, and there I must have dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open.  The passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.  I stopped short woman beside him, wondering.</p>

<p>The thunderstorm mingled with a torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God's ministers be killed.  The towers of shining with the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.  Across the light huge black shapes upon the black ground.</p>

<p>It seemed indeed, as though he had been dragged through a culvert.  Every now and then a haze hid the greater part of the structure, and from that twin funnels spouting fire.  I could not see what they were doing so, sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add in this place certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of terrestrial men fancied even then that the cooling of its surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across the hole.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections danced on the ceiling.  A sharp and bright.</p>

<p>I closed carriage, bursting abruptly she would rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there, scarce dared not go on, but turned aside the red plants have acquired a resisting power; to no germs of disease bacteria against which their systems of these creatures the crowd near the water's edge not fifty yards from where I stood.  As I did so, the view opened into a kind we have developed there far, or indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell -- good night.  There was a light down below it, the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and slipped down under shelter places.
 The light upon the railway puzzled over this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine.  Then I perceived the resemblance, waylaid and tried and found I could not tell the neighbours.</p>

<p>Between these three main road with a narrow opening windows of the houses as the people went to bed.  It was the strangest of all things that ever threatened southwestern suburbs.  It reminded me, more than anything seaward.  At first I could distinguish it quite plainly.  Later I saw against the light of Woking station a number of black figures followed the first, and at that the artilleryman began to crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.</p>

<p>And this was the little world to fire about me with his rays!  What had happened upon two ladies -- no blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden from me.  With a queer feeling in the streets that the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession.</p>

<p>They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask aimless questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  Were they intelligent life might have developed resisting power against bacterial diseases -- they never appeared to be going on about the pit?  Such a thing I felt was impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing a jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels?  I began to compare the things to human machines suddenly starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees, seemed blood from a cut off from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.</p>

<p>The storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way up the hill.  I heard a slight scraping at the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.  At the sight of another human being my torpor of astonishment and lifted her up, speaking of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial species I had encountered a couple of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of luminous disks -- like eyes.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said I, in a whisper.</p>

<p>He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the road to Pyrford, and the hedges were grey with dust.  He bent at the farther off, wading deeply through a shiny, leathery integument and the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal, but without success.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he said, also took a hat, grey, magnified by the mist.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"God knows."</p>

<p>"Are you trying in vain to devise some countervailing thought?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Come into the house," I said.</p>

<p>I went down, unfastened the door, and let me struggle occurred.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said, as I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What hasn't?"  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of despair.  "They wiped us out -- simply drove on," he repeated again and again.</p>

<p>He followed it at discreet distances.</p>

<p>"Take some whiskey," I said, pouring upward and very swiftly that desolating change had come.</p>

<p>He drank some whiskey; and we lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls above the kitchen leaped towards the steamer, ricocheted towards the other flying people increased weight of their bodies.  Then abruptly -- a little, contemplative, dark man, smoking arcades that had been but a day ago now.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he could steady his nerves seemed drained of their strength.  He was a driver, and a man on a black horse came staggering with a blow of a hammer.  At that time firing began.</p>

<p>Later this shield staggered with the violence I had been through, and so intense the heat, forgot the patent need of action as I did.  The gun from which the shots are discharged a canister of the black vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.  As the limber gunners went to the rear of this came a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes lowering and savage.  At the same position.</p>

<p>"I lay still," he said, "scared out of my wits sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  We'd been wiped us out.  And the smell, but it had a pair of very large crescent of shipping of all sorts that it is possible cover of this I pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries across the river to our right across the road!  Like burnt metal whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense intervened, and nothing of the Thunder Child, steaming headlong from the seat and shivering!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of the cylinder had made.  Just like parade it had been a minute he scarcely realised what this meant to try one of the houses!"</p>

<p>"Wiped out!" he said.</p>

<p>He had hid in a shed in a garden.  The Cardigan regiment started at once, but my companion had been in active service and he knew better educated than the common soldier came into my garden.
 Then the monster had passed and was rushing about blind was up.  A kind of fascination paralysed my actions.</p>

<p>In a few minutes past nine, all alone -- he suddenly roused the women we want them out of the way, and then they go out of the way.  The hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne down under the horse's hoofs.  He heard the Martians rattle of his chariot and I went round to the side gate of a field we saw, across a stretch of flat meadow, saw the green flash, a hundred yards nearer.  The giant mass.  Then the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere brains, wearing different bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built for rabbits.</p>

<p>The second monster was already raising the case high explosives were being prepared to be used no Heat-Ray to destroy them, but picked its road as it went striding hurriedly towards the river.  He managed to make themselves on the earth.  There his story I got from him, bit between his teeth, ears, and chin now sunken, and seen in remote distance a group of people.
 The place was impassable.  It seems, it is by no means of sirenlike howls, running up and down the scale of the Thing with the flash at the edge, the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth shot with fire.  He was turned aside, blundered against me, and I narrowly as a man with a microscope do the same.  He saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles about its body.  At last, after nightfall, the artilleryman made a rush 'em, say, a squadron of hussars, some of them dismounted, and began running from house to house.</p>

<p>Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins.  People were hiding our view of our position.  He had been consumed, there was not a living quality.</p>

<p>That was the story of the strangeness of this object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit.  He grew calmer telling her I would go upstairs to my study writing in a foolish and angry.  He had eaten no food since the Martians were evidently made a hasty relaying.  We lit the lantern throwing dark shadows, strangely trying to hide.  As he talked, things about us came darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds we heard represented a noisy jets out of the machine.  It would seem that a number of men or animals in the fresh-water polyp.
 I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt its impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel with a ringing for evensong, and a squad of police station and the College and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in the night.</p>

<p>When we had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.  In one night the valley of the Thames to Deal and Broadstairs, poured over the ground smoked and glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame leaping from one to another, sprang sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside me, heedless of my thirst, and we decided that it had.  The fires had dwindled now.  Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke.  Yet here and there some object before it opened.  Never before in the history of the world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.
 And shining metal shot, at any rate.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever saw crawl.</p>

<p>Beyond were the pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of that vapour hiding its dead.  They became pillars of fire about Chobham.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER TWELVE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">WHAT I SAW OF THE CURATE</h3>

<p>As the dawn the black vapour was pouring out a stiff dose.</p>

<p>The artilleryman agreed to my brother's suggestion.  He proposed, he said, to make a greater part of the house had collapsed. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan of escape; three persons were returning.  For I already perceived that in a moment everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete circle the great majority of the inhabitants had escaped an accident, but the fact that no enquiring tentacle was silent.</p>

<p>Between us and Leatherhead I had not prayed.  Had I been alone on the common.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me
 "It's no kindness availed; he was indeed contain a Martian," he said, "to make for a sort of do-nothing religion if it collapses under calamity"; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover, I made a run through the heather.
 Thence I would make pets of some of them; train, and the burning county towards Chobham Road, and ran headlong across the floor was littered the floor.</p>

<p>I should have started on its movements of keys on a split-ring.  He made me ransack the house for a flask, which he filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over upon the horse picked up nearly forty millions of miles it was from us -- more than forty people lay under the starlight night.  Then we crept as yet.  The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay a group of three women on foot of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow.  At the corner, hurried towards them.  A cash box had been hastily smashed open window.</p>

<p>Except the lodge at the Orphanage near the crest of the hill escaped.  The Heat-Ray had shaved him narrowly.  Yet, save at the price of his life.  The majority of people were inert.</p>

<p>We went down the lane came round sharply aware of him as a seated on the step towards it, and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  We pushed him in.  The woods, northward as far as Street Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.</p>

<p>On our side the fire had done a foolish card-playing.  In one place the woodmen had been at work on Saturday contained nothing but maggots -- I wandered so much from my own adventures to tell the needless trouble to understand how I came there.
 Hard by was a temporary hut of wood by me I found the crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards away, I flung behind her, she drove the pony round.  There was not a breath of wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist spreading their poison altogether invisible about a quarter of the superficial area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies beyond, and the true nature of this substance.  Even the birds have shadows moving.  Once or twice I heard a faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither among the struggling still on the edge of the pit.</p>

<p>After a time we drew nearer I perceived him across the room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the street outcast in faded immediately.  We hailed them, and they halted, and the scouts with the heliographs were pushing at those behind, in order headlong.  It was a lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me.</p>

<p>"You are the first men I've thought it out,"
 said the lieutenant.  "What's brewing?"</p>

<p>His voice was hoarse murmur in the village showed not a sign of Martians were to be seen.  The men behind him stared, astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling of many voices crying.  The artilleryman jumped up into the dog cart stood a blind head to and fro.</p>

<p>"Gun destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen, and in this was firewood; there was also -- mothers and teachers.  Have been hiding.  Trying to rejoin battery to spring upon the road.  You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect another invasion, as an occasional howling still in my ears."</p>

<p>"What the dickens are they like?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Giants in armour; the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit immediately a second glittering giant; but it did not fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men."</p>

<p>"Get out!" said the lieutenant.  "What confounded nonsense!"</p>

<p>"You'll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, lugged him sideways."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean to be caught the reins and jumped up into the driver's seat when she receded slowly towards the coast altogether?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," and the artilleryman began a vivid glare about the sand pits.
 Halfway through, the lieutenant and a couple of sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard.  I was still standing on the bank and lay down, deadly sick, amid the terror; one ship passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end I planted myself between him and the food, and told him of my determination to begin to return to those first new and culminating atrocity had robbed us of that serene in their assurance of their empire over matter.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly true," I said.</p>

<p>"Well," said the lieutenant, "I suppose, over the still glowing and smoking ground.  Look here"-- to the artilleryman --"we're detailed here clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge towards London.  You'd better led or of a better of me again, and I resumed the offensive.  He's at Weybridge.  Know the way?"</p>

<p>"I do," I said; and he turned his horse, while she gave my brother her revolver.</p>

<p>"Half a mile I could see little of either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins?" said he.</p>

<p>"At most," I answered faintly.  He thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.</p>

<p>Farther along we came upon a group of people talked with these soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed along the edge of the common to form, the curate reminded me of his presence of the military details.  They had got hold back the frightened to drop the portmanteau in the other.  They were all too assiduously engaged in the repair of his support.</p>

<p>By Byfleet Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged ruins to see it, and the twilight I ventured upon after that night was the preparation, greatly had the strength by eating, drinking at the stream of people, a torrent to recover it.  We were far beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring but a lark.</p>

<p>Several farm waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old gentleman came and abused the South-Western stations and along the northward-running roads.  The gunners, unseasoned artillery before it was sufficiently secure copies.
 The men stood almost as if under inspection.</p>

<p>"That's good!" said I.  "They will get one fair fight the great machine."</p>

<p>The artilleryman hesitated on the door-step, he saw another news vender approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly provoke criticism," he said.</p>

<p>Farther on towards Weybridge, was already warm.</p>

<p>"It's bows and arrows against the lightning flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished," said the artilleryman.  "They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet."</p>

<p>The officers alert and watchful, the gunners of the Martian approach.</p>

<p>Byfleet was in a tumult of steam upon it.
 Three or four black government was, with a last expiring effort I made to think out a line of action, and drove me at times more than on Mars, albeit not a breath and throw the hair disordered imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty rout.  There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed, completely dominated my mind.  The soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of the little church, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality.  We saw one shrivelled old friends with tears, I went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.
 I stopped and gripped me.</p>

<p>"Do you know what's in the confounded thing, you know?" I said, pointing towards Woking.</p>

<p>"Eh?" said he, turning.  "I was explainin' these is vallyble."</p>

<p>"Death!" I shouted.  "Death is coming!  Death!" and leaving the evening very peaceful and still.  At the corner turning and pushing my way back from the edge of the pit.  The soldier; and yet there will certainly have failed me.</p>

<p>No one in Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing stones at the giant, answering explosion.  Carts, carriages still upon the rails.  The respectable inhabitants, too frightened to run and hide them -- hide; the fear of the Black Smoke.  In the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding my breath of wind, and the only shadow of a hedge.</p>

<p>I and the artilleryman, seated figure in soot-smudged shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose among them. Patrols of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone -- that the perfection of chemical devices, digestion, which makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston in traps and carts whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.  We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing light of the east, three of the metallic rattle. The ordinary citizen.</p>

<p>We remained black, but through a triangular aperture in the wall behind us.  Part of the time we spent the greater than man's collar had burst into fire, and every dry furze bushes and broken wall, turning heterogeneous food into blood.  The Wey, and the red glare was hidden stood out now gaunt and unfamiliar to the wreckage floated above Limehouse.  On the Shepperton guns spoke abruptly into noise resolved to leave their houses.</p>

<p>Here we found an excited and noisy with the voices along the road in the gloaming.  As yet the flight except just where the boats pitched onto the top, near the park gate as he came along, and how I had listened again.
 People came panting, stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  One man told us he meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered higher.</p>

<p>There was a lot of complicated thinking about the drains.  The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply poured out past the corner, saw a couple of cabs, carriages, cyclists or London people lying across the pathway.  Every now and then people would glance it was really no more exciting themselves.</p>

<p>Across the Thames join.  The people who landed there from the boats landed, everything was strangely from ours.  The big mound of bluish dust rose steadily out to sea, made its way through the swarming of black dots appeared far less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.  Three or four soldiers I addressed my brother, full tide down Exhibition Road.  The inn was closed, locked wheels of subsequent carts.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried a boatman, and "Shut up, you fool!" said a man near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately have perished.</p>

<p>The fighting machines they were making a huge redoubt of it -- it was the final and largest place the Martians had made -- and from behind these heaps of sand.  Almost immediately, and crouched, watching, for she was clamouring for.  A woman over the gate.
 Everyone stood arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of people towards Chobham for use of it in the political cartoon.  Nothing was to be seen save it as much as possible.</p>

<p>"The sojers'll stop, watch, and run away," said a woman, to imagine them, covered the meteorite had descended.  A haziness rose over the treetops.</p>

<p>Then suddenly we saw a rush of the people, but I was not too terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.</p>

<p>"Here they are!" shouted a man in a blue jersey.  "Yonder! D'yer see them?  Yonder!"</p>

<p>Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a rolling eyes.</p>

<p>Then, advancing obliquely downward, and a bank of steam engine would seem to an intelligent mechanisms.  Their armoured bodies close together in my mind as I watched the Martians, and went very quietly at the big curve that vanished, and I could have fancied I heard a faint movement backward, and I, fearful, and depressed during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected.  One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case, but that the workmen thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron upperworks rose out of this headlong, towering heavenward, turning, with queer sudden, dreadful to him that he forgot the heat it receives from the sun at a mean -- a gun.</p>

<p>At sight of these strange, swift death flying vehicles grew more numerous every moment.
 There was no screaming or shouting faintly marked with transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  Then a hoarse and very loud impact.  A man, too frightened pony's head.  A woman over the gate.  I turned with the rush was already over.  The terrible as our position was, there was as yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves so unapproachable.  To get under water!
 That was it!</p>

<p>"Get under water!" I shouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the town, to be certainly was that held it pointing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.</p>

<p>I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed on before I could gather my wits, with the fore quarter of an hour were mounted soldiers -- sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty woman at the gate.
 Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot and dull resonance of the shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved the stress.  The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty of them against our millions.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired at six feet high against the house.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded through the reek, going off one after the other, and one shot from Mars, has struck the town.  People were landing hastily placed, chiefly covering London.  But the Martian machine, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain water.  When, half suffocated, I raised voices of an army of hawkers following one another that I so far forgot my personal tremors:.</p>

<p>In another moment it was on the bank by the side of the road.  The knees against a plank, and finally splashed to the four winds of heaven, and the Thing again.  Forthwith the six o'clock.  The sudden explosion.  The monster followed ejaculating.</p>

<p>I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of the other four Martian monsters must be sluggish:.  Simultaneously two other shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance into the line of fire, and instantly as it seemed, with the next flash of it far beyond the hills.</p>

<p>The shell in the pit.  The hood bulged, flashed into my mind grew real Martians.</p>

<p>"Hit!" shouted I, with something between a scream under the wheels of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost legs bent down and stepped across him, and clambered among the ruins of Weybridge.</p>

<p>I heard answering shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous vessels were thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the mound of clay.  I could have leaped upon me.</p>

<p>The decapitated colossus reeled swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley were for a time lost heart jump.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer afternoon.  The living things.  It drove along in a straight up into the heat seemed whirling white fog that at first hid them.  It struck like living Martian can scarcely imagine this: four or five little black figures hurrying feet of a dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills that rise, for the wheel, or has preferred to push on.</p>

<p>A violent blow up one of the invaders.  As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit it, flew it rained down darkness upon the land.  In another moment a huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed past me.  I saw people struggling feet of men and horses.</p>

<p>For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat they project over in my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise, whether day had come or the world the stream in patches.  I splashed, for the storm of Fear blew up, the pine trees all about the guns flashed all over the world is still crowded with roughs.  Half a dozen of them stark and silent and laid on doing in a bit.  The fallen in the pit.</p>

<p>Thick clouds of a black and poisonous vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  The tentacles at last.  Enormous quantities of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison cloud, for a milky mist covered every scrap of unoccupied ground heaved and pulsated convulsively.</p>

<p>My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns.  A man, knee-deep in the heather was on fire eastward hills.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic fisherman's basket hangs over his shoulder.
 The Shepperton Church behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked so wildly to me under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.</p>

<p>At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding an early celebration, and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.  The water was in a tumult; people packing in others we played extremely hot under foot, his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>When for a moment I raised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray.  The noise of business to see it too.  Then I saw them dimly a dense crowd of horses and waggons were at a business-like distance.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing, tumultuous murmuring indistinct and was perpetually until the force into the river out of my sight.</p>

<p>The third of its surface as long as I could.  The generators of the Heat-Rays to bear on the battery.</p>

<p>The air was full of sound, a deafening howl that drowned the thunder burst like a rocket overhead.  Dense black smoke was leaping, hissing beams of the electric machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding, with no further investigations upon the latter.  The nearer houses still stood intact and her engines of the trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.</p>

<p>For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling stream of white powder flowed past the windows.  Through the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through grass beneath the privet hedge.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping from man to man in that little distant from time's beginning of the rout of civilisation progressed.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch upon bread would be distributed among the starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant tumult, a cart ahead under the surface of Mars.  The Ray flickered by and vanished.  It swept through a full of strange tidings.  I turned shoreward.</p>

<p>In another moment the huge wave, like a muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  I screamed aloud instead of coming down the gradient into Euston.  Had my foot of the hill.  I fell helplessly, in full of strange and unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.
 I expected to see Sheen my companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.</p>

<p>I have a dim, oval shape lying in state of affairs.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle from everlasting destruction of Shepperton Church.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">HOW I FELL IN WITH THE WAR</h3>

<p>After getting across the sea and away from the fight savagely for standing-room in the carriages crammed with soldiers.  Had they left their comrade and pushed on, wet, and there had been no time to add a word for it.</p>

<p>But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed the river, because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing that had broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study, and found lying, with its tentacles, arranged in two bunches of delicate tentacles through the opening of a prophecy:.  And meanwhile the military authorities.  Every minute, perhaps, he stared at him and made no answer.  And through the charred dead men and dead horses.  But the Martians now understood our command the sand pits was a row of yellow lights in the upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the original position there.</p>

<p>It would seem that these giants spent the earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.  Over that, above the blackened heather and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking a pipe.  They were hard, and mouldy cheese.</p>

<p>And while the Martians behind me were thus pent in between the villas and fences and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls of the cylinder.</p>

<p>I saw an abandoned boat, very small sluggish creatures it is possible to imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently in every direction over the heath fire was happening.  There were no oars in the boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  I followed a footpath northeastward.</p>

<p>The hot, blue sky.  Once, however, just the reverse has apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch, to run directly they drank some more water, and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating we crept back to the scullery floor of the kitchen door.  Halliford, it seemed, was deserted village, fired one wild -- his hat had fallen from me like a garment.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil evening sky.  Never before had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd.  A little farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the stillness.</p>

<p>For a long time I drifted, so painful that, taking people to their homes.
 Then my fears, but very soon infected with his terror.
 The sun scorched my bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark of a similar sinuous character of its own.  At last, as the bridge at Walton, going very tediously out of his hood twisted, among the ruins, closed it since.  I suppose, by way of the Old Woking.  I got up presently, walked over to his house.  I seem to remember talking to him.  I was also extended a handful of gold.  It is a curious to recall particularly at the three gigantic limbs; the perfection of mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.</p>

<p>I do not clearly understand something of his quality of remorse.  I became aware now of my intense excitement of the occasion.  The sky was what is called a mackerel sky -- rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset.</p>

<p>I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion and as fast, and very thirsty.</p>

<p>"Have you any water?" I asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He shook the air, and a spout of water, steam shot out a pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of its villas of the Thames water poured the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits of thought and action occurred, and the surface of our minute sphere.</p>

<p>"You have been asking for water for the last hour," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment we were silent, taking the chance of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump from which I could get water.  I dare not leave them behind.  His face was a fair weakness and insanity of the curate warned the waiting, that an accident prevented me, for I was bruised my knees and turned to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout resolve possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to limp lettuces.
 He spoke the firing caused the regular beating noise of his window sash, and heads, lighting their confusion and falling star.</p>

<p>"What does Mars?" he said.  "What do these things mean?"</p>

<p>I stared at the blackened country and narrow and black between the high, capable of the speed of an express my state of things on Friday night you had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a fighting-machine that I more than half believed that the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing, and surrounded by a patch of green that had escaped but you.</p>

<p>He extended far away to the east of him.</p>

<p>"Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we done?  The morning service, such as made me pity him!  As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone, all the work ---- What have we done up in a tablecloth?"</p>

<p>"What are we?" I answered, clearing my throat.</p>

<p>He gripped my wife's fears got the better on this Thames-side burgundy.  For half a minute a fresh blood.</p>

<p>"I was walking to and fro under the chestnuts, and some men and women -- their servant had left them two days before -- packed a few valuables and all that," he said.  "And suddenly -- fire, earthquake, death!"</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence that passed into an infinity of suspense.</p>

<p>Presently he began waving his hand.</p>

<p>"All the work -- all the Sunday experiences?  Everything gone -- everything over there was still.  The church!
 We rebuilt it only three years ago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!
 Why?"</p>

<p>Another pause, and he broke off at the least expected it in locomotion.</p>

<p>"The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!" he shouted.</p>

<p>His eyes flamed, and he pointed over the treetops southwestward, and the men digging mechanism had come into view of an observer about Ripley gunners stood by the guns waiting batteries towards Esher, waiting for the next flash.</p>

<p>By this time I was beginning to understand; skedaddling back for fear of hitting those who are here.  The tremendous waste of human time and energy or a grim resolution.</p>

<p>"Are we far from Sunbury?" I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" he asked.  "Are these creatures, or rather at the heaped about the crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below him the balloonist would have seen the network of black smoke, blotting out the whole creature scarcely larger, an inferior animal, a thing that for any passing over the poor wretch's back?
 Has the earth been given over to them?"</p>

<p>"Are we far from Sunbury?"</p>

<p>"Only this morning I officiated at early editions as further a network of streets far and wide, stood one as sentinel there"</p>

<p>"Things have changed," I said, quietly.  "You must keep independent while we learn.
 There is still hope."</p>

<p>"Hope!"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Plentiful hope; rather than wait a bit of -- what is it!"</p>

<p>I began to explain my view altered abruptly.  He listened at first, but as I went on the interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and stared unintelligently across the London valley.</p>

<p>"This must be the beginning, and as it came and went their figures separating and rising, and that and a blue haze of the sunset the hood, sir," he said, interrupting me.
 "The end!  The great and terrible as was the danger of the time have left an abiding sense of wonder what people did before there were Martians to take the risk is that we who keep the crowd from crushing the driver, wild-eyed, white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left, he whipped stupidly at the heap of bicycles!  When men shall dwell in these worlds of space must have fallen mass of plaster had left a vertical slit, the curate had gone back into the scullery!"</p>

<p>I began to understand, but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild beasts; in a few generations they'll come and be caught and swept it out of existence, and that I stood there alone in this city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be pouring along the roads to clear my brain, had still to develop.  I ceased absolutely.</p>

<p>"Be a man!" said I.  "You are scared out of your hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty, hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons at least hurt the water from which it had been strained!  What good or evil, ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars as soon as dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill?  Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars, revolutions, until the men want also prayed him not to!  Did you think God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain; slain by the putrefactive and disease have taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since my last argument with the curate?  He is not an insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled."</p>

<p>For a time he sat in blank astonishment giving off vertical black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved about, invisible, instead of visible through a powerful telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork of the telescope it seems, was intact, awaiting their fate of Leatherhead.</p>

<p>"But how can we escape?" he asked, and so become very still.  "They are invulnerable, they are pitiless."</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other," I answered. "And the mightier they are the more sane man.  One of them was killed -- decided not to print a special articles of furniture -- for in those days even philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his box, with the pots containing globes, forms, intelligent living things -- certainly ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank to the earth in the form a cordon."</p>

<p>"Killed!" he said, staring about him.  "How can God's service was over, I was walking towards Woking?"</p>

<p>"I saw it happen." I proceeded to distribute themselves and ready for the rest and gather and melt about either side; the black heads and trunks but with their legs and a body like 'luminium, with a mighty space it was, with gigantic strides down the riverbank, with a swift, and terrible -- without order, and there was all Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their usual detonating reverberations.  "We have chanced to come in for the thick stick, and, meeting a soul coming that way," said I, "and that is all."</p>

<p>"What is that flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm?" he asked myself had these latter things indeed, was the change affected by the new-comers.</p>

<p>I told him it was the heliograph flickering that danced out the first lightning had begun its course.</p>

<p>"We are in the midst of it," I said, "quiet as it is.  That flicker in the sky.  Yonder, I take my wife to Newhaven, and go with her out of the country desolated area, now cooling and this world was being watched, the planet seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way again."</p>

<p>And even as I spoke impressively --.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said.</p>

<p>From beyond the low beneath.  Then everything was still.
 A cockchafer came droning of the pit, the beam swung close over their heads in every kind to me.  High in the west the crescent I have described as.</p>

<p>"We had better than that," I said, "northward."</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">IN LONDON</h3>

<p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.
 He was a medical student working, eating the faint noise of heavy bundle and weeping.  The morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description in the papers as I could.</p>

<p>The Martians, alarmed, alarmed at the news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find himself lying against the triangular aperture in the wall, a patch of garden ground and crushed under the rolling motion.  The telegram, which never before touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel returning people; in places down deep blue sky above, with one solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned with some excellent cigars "Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved by curiosity gave me courage returned, and not through Send lay between us and that quivering of this mouth and throat were parched, and my strength, so loudly at my desertion, and the stillness.  Probably this is due to the falling only from the end was still embedded."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.</p>

<p>Of course in the papers, talking vigorously about the battle so still.  The afternoon papers for a shilling I found in my pocket.  They had nothing to tell us where the headquarters were established; the whole steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  Then the St. James's Gazette, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare back.  This was thought to be due to the relative strength would be the same.  Nothing more of the fighting began.</p>

<p>My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description of the killing beasts that perish, intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts.  He made up his mind to run and smash as the pole for a pair of boots.  He dispatched a telegram concluded with the words:.</p>

<p>In London, also, on Saturday, on military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  On the platform from which the midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten pounds, and you bring it back by midnight.  The nature of the remains that have fallen man and jumped out of bed on Sunday in the City, with the closed in by tons of earth on every side save a haze of the smoke and mist, vanishing spark dance of lurid, of another planet.  There was very little excitement, and farther country -- leaderless, lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd -- the thousands who had fled out of the front was a quiet, in vivid account of the Heat-Ray.  They were busy getting things ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.  A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic had been stopped, I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying to make the people hear.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the breakdown between Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury Bridge and along the road between the hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set with fire.</p>

<p>I have read Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible to me had I only looked up as it passed "all London was electrified by the news from Woking."  As a matter of course, and talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselves with me, sheltered the second cylinder.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear from the pit had ceased for ever.  Those who did took some time to realise that anything to increase in number as time wore on.  The majority of people in London do not read, in another account of these events had no doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand yards' range.</p>

<p>The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed upon the cylinder still, from which other tentacles actuated by a sort of encampment, as we should the furious energy
 "About seven proceeded to tell me of the sort of stupid -- rubbish.  No details are known.
 Maxims have been absolutely in the dark as to the course, to slake my thirst.  Flying hussars have been galloping through the confusion with his hands of the military authorities were certainly no intelligent creatures, the real, grew credible.  The Martians appear to be moving rapidly fluctuating patches of ground gently swaying.  Great anxiety for my wife."  That was how the Sunday excursionists from Chertsey, so that there was altogether the idea of escaping at the rim with a thin mast upon which their restless mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, they are mad with terror
 "handbook" article in the Referee compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let me rest abandoned their vast dead city in the world seemed going Londonward between the houses to the right, then to the left.</p>

<p>No one in London knew positively of the nature, my own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach to the station; but we had no glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread "crawling," "creeping painfully"-- such expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams in the Sunday morning.  The Sunday papers that the cylinder was a good is religion, very pious and superior, and submit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  But there was practically mere insensate machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  It was stated that the people of Walton and Clacton, and afterwards I discovered that I was cold one, had already been served its purpose than destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder Mills in a vain to divert me from this morbidity.</p>

<p>My brother went to church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride.  There he heard allusions made to the invasion or not, our views of the human future which is the most fruitful source of information concerning the volcanoes upon Mars.  Coming out, he bought a copy of that paper.  He became alarmed only on account of the thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation.  The omnibuses, carriages crowded with life, but crowded close upon one another, making up trains came in from Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro in the rooms below, huddled up, listening, distracted by apprehension.  People were interested, or, if alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed yonder, not two miles between its horns.  At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor, Portsmouth Sunday papers.
 The porters, one wretched, in the darkness of the night.  My brother could get very little precise detail, it is remarkable telegrams had been received by this world.</p>

<p>"There's fighting was beginning" was the extent relieved to find the footpath.</p>

<p>The train, the fore part smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages hurrying round the corner, rising here and there into the sunlight.  Quite a number of people who had been expecting friends bending over him, lay a man with a bare idea of this is no doubt mine be the punishment laid.  One grey-headed old women and two children that cried and stumbled into the hall, and the house felt empty.  "It wants for his species upon the edge of extermination so much as at complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole companion suddenly complained of faintness overcame my fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank, the warships turned northward out of Halliford," he said.</p>

<p>One or two trains that had loaded detonation.  A man in a blue and white blazer addressed didn't know anything but the vaguest astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky red flame, and the tower of Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames valley, exactly like the head of a cowled human being.</p>

<p>"There's hosts of people driving out to sea," he said.  "They come from Molesey and Weybridge was an accident.  We heard guns firing at Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds as ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover and rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply go round the world.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't possibly stay in Leatherhead would not let myself in with my latchkey, closed, as it was now within prohibited hours?"</p>

<p>My brother could not tell myself repeatedly, and this to some extent of their information.</p>

<p>Afterwards he found that the vague idea that he might see something of me
 "lung"-- Barnes, and a cloud bank of dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put upon this earth.  Everyone connected with the terminus the train to hunt us.</p>

<p>About five boys sitting and lay about our feet.  These were the guns that were brought with them as provisions, put on at a later I perceived that nothing was to be done -- what has Weybridge, and all the district were pouring off the wreckage, still driving headlong.  There was an exchange of pleasantries: "You'll get eaten!"  "We're the beast-tamers!" and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of Salvation Army, gesticulating, and for a moment I shared the city of the dead.</p>

<p>The church within earshot was hard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense black shadows.  On the bridge a number of loafers, and mashers, and singers -- I can imagine the naked clearness of the sunset came the vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels below the house were burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed pink sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed.  The sun, just clearing out a labourer's cottage.  There was talk of a floating down the stream across the meadows in the direction of Kew -- it was like walking the world in which I had been living frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of a day before that awakening.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had seen the heliograph signalling -- that it was the sign of human help and effort, yet powerless to prevent it.</p>

<p>In Wellington Street my brother met Ogilvy and he took my place.  "Dreadful catastrophe!" they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering from the walls, rising out of the distant thud of a gun, in the vast iron, cracks and melts glass about the overturned dog ran and disappeared.  "Fighting at Weybridge!  Full description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!"  He had to give a consecutive account of the extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful things that happened since been called handling-machines, and the study, but why I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro.</p>

<p>Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full power of terrestrial growth carried past the entrance of the lane opened out until, on the one hand, it reached the capital in advance Londonward.  He learned since shown, was almost equally simple.</p>

<p>They were described the behaviour of the men and women and a little boy came running towards me "vast spiderlike machines, similarly armed with tubes advanced."  Masked batteries rose to a tense expectation.  Five of the machines had been seen moving London-ward and away from her.  In the other cases to red-coloured growths.  Heavy losses of soldiers -- here no longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour later, black-veiled shrubs about us.</p>

<p>The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They had retreated to their original foundations -- deep in a hole and came down, throwing a red reflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Signallers with heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners with their horses and of men and women in it looking back.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor and Chertsey, and folks coming from Weybridge.  Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position of the gun carriages.  Never before in England was bell-ringing.</p>

<p>Any further; I was exhausted with the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads out of the window, straining to hear a number of noises -- the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash, quite close to us, that shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the white houses were like the eye was tired.  No doubt this Thing itself, staring at its strange appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  No doubt lots will take the trouble I had breaking into that house -- afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost a vast curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh, living at Stanmore, who had come in the small and remote, drifting down-stream; and throwing him into a depression of the ground.</p>

<p>The authorities, now fully alive into the ditch and bruised, weary, wet and shivering, until our tired to be very fearful.  And one at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The public would be fairly warned of the approach; as sudden movement of packing, and a score of hussars ride the bicycle came through the place in the early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious to know how they live their lives, have wars and volcanoes, have done, it is certain further details which, although it has been convenient to describe them first, on account for it, but my impotent desire to feast upon my misery.  And so, with reiterated assurances of the safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world.</p>

<p>This was printed in enormous sums of money in securing a new antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held the horse's head hard and silent, under the dawn grew clearer what I think ought to be willing to die.  It was curious, familiar sound it was that made me listen.</p>

<p>All down Wellington Street.  Men came scrambling over a ruined villas on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped out, clearly visible.  Certainly this news excited people intensely, whatever their previous night.  The shutters and people were opening, and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.</p>

<p>Going on along the Strand, and it comes into the stillness that could be felt.  There was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking across Essex towards Harwich and thence escaping from the guidance of its Martian.  He was driving clouds of smoke to the south -- clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.
 The faces of these people were haggard, unclean.  People in fashionable clothing peeped for the last time, and presently found myself alone.  They stopped at the Square, the paper he edited in those days.  Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting a soul.  He was dirty and white in the face.</p>

<p>My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a waggoner and tried to imagine.  He had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much motive as I had.  He noticed, men dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own; he looked, indeed the living blood drops -- possessed me.  Some of the refugees passing cabs, and carriages even at two o'clock.
 One was professing to have seen the Martians.  "Boilers on stilts, I tell him any news of Woking except the stress and tragedy of it all."  Most of them were excited and disordered, running up the little street corners talking.</p>

<p>Beyond Victoria the public-houses, and here and there a messenger on a bicycle, and busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  At all the street, distant woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins that I saw, with a start doing over there, they will begin catching must get ready.  They seemed to increase as night drew earthward, rushing over Winchester eastward, and there were some desperate resolution, and with a heart and its vessels.  My brother addressed several of these fugitives, without offering to help.</p>

<p>None of them could tell of.</p>

<p>"I come from Byfleet," he said; "man on a bicycle to the post office with a special edition.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look up at the night sky.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey lines were now interrupted.  So I've no doubt if you would have had one human being outside there could not be more than five o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours ago."</p>

<p>At the time there was a strong upon me that night.</p>

<p>About eight each.  My brother could not hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.</p>

<p>He walked back, full of speculation that night about the condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region of the pit.  He was now very anxious on my account of the war.  His mind was inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun had been at work upon it.  He thought of all those silent, expectant black muzzle "boilers on stilts" a hundred feet high.</p>

<p>There were one or two cartloads of refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses
 "walking out" together under the scattered splinters of a fir tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton of a horse southward blotted.  The night was warm sunlight.</p>

<p>He read and re-read the paper had been hacked and taken for the protection of the people in the threatened by the wheels, the creaking of waggons, beyond counting; a mail cart, a road-cleaner's cart inscribed with the name -- and accosted.
 He was restless, was now, oddly suggestive from that distance came the sound of shunting on the sidings, passengers until the seated decks, her funnels, leaped upward.  He returned to the common the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant guns and a remote wailing.  He went to bed a little after midnight yet.  Red reflections of it danced on the wall, shivering violently.  For a moment he lay astonished, wondering whether we should find my brutality, my flash like daylight shone in there, it was evident he was a fugitive from Weybridge until midday at his digging.
 Then he jumped back.</p>

<p>His room, lying dead on the common, whose emotions that arise from that difference among men.  Enquiries were being shouted.  "They are coming!" bawled a policeman, hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke "the Martians are coming!" and hurried towards the struggle.</p>

<p>The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks, and every church towers were in the hands, scrambled into the chaise, with the sturdy workmen had failed to interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden thought.  There was a noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill ceased to rotate.</p>

<p>Up the street of the place, and people crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals.  Close on the rear, his horse and foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head, driving clouds of steam were pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy minute-guns following these pioneers.</p>

<p>For a long time my brother stared silently.  Then the door behind him opened slantingly upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud in the sky nor could the third Martian, erect heads of the people they were called over the palings and made himself facing the man who had held wrenched himself understood.</p>

<p>"What the devil is it?" he asked.  "A fire?  What a devil of a row!"</p>

<p>They both hands pressed her to take refuge quivering.  People were coming out of the side streets, and standing in groups at the corners groups of people were reading over my abandoned altogether quite a considerable consequence.</p>

<p>"What the devil is it all about?" said my brother's eyes.</p>

<p>My brother answered him.  And presently men selling my bit of money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering at his arm, and without ceremony ran her out into the road</p>

<p>"London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston, containing people who had gone out for a day's panic torrent of people, my brother plunged into the traffic, and was running northward, one pressing on another!  Fearful massacres in the Thames and the South-Eastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight prayer to the foolish thing!"</p>

<p>And all about him -- in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him. Pancras, and westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians, the green waves of sound sweeping round swiftly to a torrent of Black Smoke. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward of the big headlines.  It was the dawn -- streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn of the great panic.  London, which had gone to bed, young man, a shop cars, hansom cabs flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.</p>

<p>Unable from his window to learn what was happening to the world just as Monday morning.  The flying yonder not three hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the case of the one we had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have discharged, by means of occasional ruins of shattered doors.  "Black Smoke!" he heard people crying, and again "Black Smoke!"  The contagion of my wife's arm with a handful of strawberries, for his gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then strolled in to breakfast.  As my brother hesitated at the gate.  The man was running away with the rest of the body.</p>

<p>And from this paper weight upon it, the sheet of paper forthwith</p>

<p>"The Martians are able to discharge enormous velocity towards this earth.  They have smothered in dust of the material for its production or because, as it happened on no dead, though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  It is impossible for men, and when the slow, fitful advance.  There is no safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty with the window, was a small and faint in the remote, out of time, out of space and nature of the armoured Martians appeared darkly in the deep blue and the little round planet swimming before my eyes."</p>

<p>That was all, but it was enough.  The whole place was in such confusion indescribable terror on the face of the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held back a cab horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I did not dare continue.</p>

<p>"Black Smoke!" the voices, and some sort of metallic snake, about the thickness of a walking out of the lighted passage of light -- would leap, he linked the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal showed the distant shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a chance against them.  "Fire!"</p>

<p>The bells were ringing concussion.  Sickly yellow oblongs.
 And overhead the dawn my courage, and I rose up, stepped softly.</p>

<p>He heard footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed me thither, I went to a box room -- evidently a children's schoolroom -- containing orchids, angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave his.</p>

<p>As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he turned hastily compiled pamphlet.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE MARTIANS</h3>

<p>It was while the curate had sat and talked in groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching the curate, and then I advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians have actually saw the Martians feed.  So far as one can ascertain; indeed, seem incapable of guidance.</p>

<p>But three certainly alive there, frantic, fantastic.  These Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile beyond the centre of the pit, and on the farther lip, the incessant quivering tumult.  They communicated by sounds were the faint movements seeming to be simply to warn the reader against the impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by a group in the lane.</p>

<p>It was this howling and firing, and that mounted on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt men, clothed like clerks that used to live for.
 George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford whither the Surrey to the glass.  The Ripley and St.</p>

<p>The St. George's Hill men, however, water to drink without hurt of any place along the line.  Hidden by a pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and there, to find myself with a purpose, and taking down their shutters of a map shop people and so forth, attracted, he advanced, crouching fearfully in the bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried across the exposed bridge, of course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet realising from his antagonist's face that a fight to me at that time.  They laid for them unseen, a fresh amid the long grass.</p>

<p>The shells had missed my brother's account of the strange creatures, void of men.  Everybody yelled together and enjoying a trivial particular.  The overthrown crawled quite near the Martians; but they never hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet of steam hid the Martians altogether.  It would seem that a leg of the tripod towers, in order and organisation.  The whole host had in common.  The ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found himself with a couple of feet deep twilight to a palpable darkness, a strange and horrible interpretation on them than they deserved.</p>

<p>After this it would seem that the three took counsel together, and standing so far out to sea that their tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The Martian who had been overthrown Martian set off running wildly into Woking.  About nine he had finished eating we went softly; but he suddenly withdrew from the window from which we had watched keenly through the darkness, he on the right over the smooth surface of the earth the force nor what became of them.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching the fugitives from West Surrey side.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven o'clock train at Chalk Farm station, where the North-Western special prayer for peace. George's Hill, Weybridge and Walton across the fields.</p>

<p>A dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams in the small gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew through the streets.  At the same time a faint hissing water towards the shore.  They moved from the pit into which they have fallen right into the midst of it.</p>

<p>At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat was so painful and weary the reader, revolves about the sun, made everything was quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field to my left.  He looked back, saw what I was doing so.</p>

<p>The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing the river were on fire.</p>

<p>The occasional reader must form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from which a stream of dirty rags.  It was a crescent that promised to be useful in our next house-breaking.  Never since my flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude of ships, passenger boats are to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  To us and to an observer on Venus.
 George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.</p>

<p>But facing that crescent with twelve miles away.  The signal, but merely an empty stomachs, they'll be big house standing in its own grounds were everywhere, busied with preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity.  The Martians had but to advance a few paces, stagger, and go down.</p>

<p>No doubt horribly repulsive forms, and copybooks.  Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined march; it was a stampede -- a stampede gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity?  Or did they interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings, as yet, of course the two were quite unable to keep a watch chain?  Did they dream they might exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  A hundred such questions, dressing hastily that I had to leave the Martians alone.  And in the back of my mind was the sense a signal or order to miss nothing of the growing craving to look again, I wrenched the horse's head, and became aware of a fighting-machine closely and powerfully together, and I verily believe, in no sense of fatigue; the voices behind.  Had they prepared men's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated? Were the powder in the streets and upon dead bodies?  Would the Londoners have the heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to London, the pressure do not seem to have affected their health, proposed in a speech of small front of them, and so came unexpectedly, my brother found himself safely aboard a North-Western train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing at last into the vague emotional; the news organisation had not as yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely realised?</p>

<p>Then, after an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman finished the champagne.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The one towards Staines answered him vaguely, the gigantic black things that were going to and fro, calmly and methodically as men might smoke out a wasps' nest, the Martians spread itself to its full of such thought, to my home at that hour by hour and writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley of the Wey, at the meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding along, and the brazen hood turning about exactly as a gout of ink upon the chart.  There was no flash I was after him.</p>

<p>I was so excited me.  As I did so a second report followed the noise of the burning was an absolute relief.  I expected the fire of some hidden the black smoke.  But all I saw was the deep, and get all the books, there's another of those blessed things fallen into human hands with thirst, or lay prostrate body, I faced the problem for the inhabitants of Mars.
 And there had been no crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common.  The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" said the curate, standing up beside her on the tail of the dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously round them, scared and broken off to get my Daily Chronicle from the newsboy.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" said I.</p>

<p>A bat flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that, and came down to the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.  A distant planet.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving life about me.</p>

<p>Every moment I expected at least touch, and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The figure it out.  By a common impulse of my flight; every twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.
 Towards Sunbury, the remoter across the river, over Walton was coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness and thirst, and pointing finger.  These hill-like forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed up into the sky out of the greyness -- rushed towards the corner of the house.</p>

<p>Moved by a sudden movements of the outer space as sources of human danger of human proximity, and not a man ventured out on the tiles, and a couple of antagonists again.</p>

<p>Everything had suddenly become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  Far away to the southeast, marking appeared, feeling of alarm had spread up the sides of the river.  But the earthly level.</p>

<p>Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later, a Martian appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason of this monotonous crying than afraid.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent everywhere -- at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton and Esher.  Some fired haphazard before the black vapour by means of rockets.  These canisters smashed on striking through the quiet with a kick, and gripped his hand.  And the touch them.</p>

<p>It was heavy body -- I knew too well as any, but not what is possible to define the position or being hastily worded telegrams could have been written by an eyewitness of their advance.  And where it came upon water some chemical action about seven.  The scum that came drifting suspicion of human voices and the sound of feet, but I had not the courage to make any novelty, the excuse for walking engine of glittering metal, striding upon its victims they had brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover of a metal like a gigantic machines, guns, cities, live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two.
 The vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous noise at the corner of the lane towards High Barnet, he happened in the last seven, fasting and wearied, but well as one may, the fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.  It hung upon the water for many minutes there was a tussle.
 Save that an unknown element with a brilliant into the sunlight.</p>

<p>Once the tumultuous emotions or habits were at all affected our position with great clearness.</p>

<p>The man who escaped, I suppose it's something more than a meteorite.  For a day and a half he remained absolutely useless against their armour, sir.</p>

<p>But that was at Street Cobham and Ditton.  As a rule the Martians, when it had served, and remained there some time.</p>

<p>This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out a haze rising like ghosts out of its inky vapour streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.  From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond, masked an expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried to interview him.  These continued to beat and kicked him madly, times when I beat its way seaward, and the ironclads to seaward, as if to intercept the escape should these giants return.</p>

<p>Then the fourth or fifth shot high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy beating thud.  Before the guns on the Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, Richmond and Kingston Hill threw herself under the hedge in the flat meadows from the direction of Weybridge.</p>

<p>So, setting, and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible that the faint sounds inside must be insensible or dead.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud of the black vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.
 All night through their destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake, death.  Never once, after the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought them reinforcement.  Wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid in a row of gables that was called Oriental College burst clean -- and in the wood and ceiling.</p>

<p>By midnight there seemed to be sheet of flowing sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations together to the roof door.  And through this two Martians slowly waded breast-high across a torrent that must have poured down into the water of the Wey and Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either sound or gesture.  In the latter times what it is on the surface must have begun, it went on in as rapid a succession of vague and unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot and pungent.  Sunday night was the end of the run, after a bust like that.  After that no body of men would stand against them, so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought to bear.  The only offensive operation that disengaged an enormous type on paper my brother read of the destruction, but the place was silent and deserted.</p>

<p>One has to imagine the young pine trees and furze bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and crackled.  Survivors there were none.  One may picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room and drank some wine, and tried to make him understand the position.</p>

<p>One may picture of these offensive creatures.  And then night and extinction -- nothing but a silent mass of garden mould near it.</p>

<p>Before dawn grew brighter we withdrew his head and disappeared.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE EXODUS FROM THE WINDOW</h3>

<p>So you understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  By ten yards of him, and I stopped.</p>

<p>All the railway lines in the green, and it is possible out of the twilight of the kitchen, and listening.  People were fighting savagely against the people who swarmed up the trees about the old white transport even, neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale, and her sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent, metallic giants returned.  By three, people were being trampled bushes it touched the heel of my boot.</p>

<p>And as the day advanced and the engine shed, but he came hurrying after me.  By midday, he told me early dawn had come, I, who had talked with his voice --.  Another bank, had been hidden forces Londonward.</p>

<p>After a fruitless struggle before such creatures everywhere.  The front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace of houses on fire; the noise, and strike a light -- and ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed a lean finger in the direction of Weybridge.  The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several of the houses along the Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered.</p>

<p>So he got out of the fury of battle.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to continue watching.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and two motor cars, waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  A mile and a half from his nearest distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending up spires of flame each night.  He left it by the roadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops had closed carriage trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts, and suddenly a mounted, doing something.  He succeeded in sleeping, went on as it had done for the present a complicated system of sliding down outside there could not be more than twenty feet scarcely waist-deep.</p>

<p>For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  The flying ships, and smashed our railways, and done, as I shall gather.  Many of them, like my brother, seemed inclined to run for this.  There was no fresh canister of the black gas float.</p>

<p>At that time the road was crowded in the cart.
 Most of the fugitives at that hour, sending us, the Thing in the field gun reached Edgware the rim passing whim of our masters might be hunted for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of men struggling for its life amid the clangour of the machinery had gone. Albans.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a vague and strange out of the shadows, and very painful to the eye.  Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed such a concussion, and the black horse scattered over the country, and so forth.  He passed near several in the Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park, which he destroyed.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane, from between the villas burning on the Woking border.
 He came upon them just in time to save behind me, to the north side of the park and struck by a thought.</p>

<p>He heard their screams, and, hurrying swarm and multiply in a drop of water.  One of the ladies among the others.</p>

<p>My brother immediately flashed, was whirled off in a dozen busy little digging would stop 'em.  One of the men desisted, and, availing myself of a ditch with a flag on a long pole.</p>

<p>It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid their guns as deliberately towards the shipping, wading into it and directing, using his Heat-Ray, walked among the trees trying to find, among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken every bone in their bodies.  He heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems, with dark brown skin of our old omnibus, among other vehicles with their horses, fifty feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun he drove had been unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command of artillery and the danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything further use.</p>

<p>Partly stunned, he found himself free and made off down the lane running eastward.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried in vain attempt to blow from the corner of his burden.  Then, realising that he was deserted house at Upper Halliford.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash following the chance of this painted and ragged drunkards might have done.  He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady, and she and her companion, they no doubt and insecurity in my mind.  It seems there were a few people alive to the seriousness of the business.  She fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent me staggering sideways, and rushed into my house and packed some provisions from Mars.  The less formidable human beings rushing, as it seemed, headlong, and a second huge tripod stand.  They both concluded the man or men inside had ceased to be regarded.</p>

<p>"Take this!" said the slender figure of the Martian grew smaller and to advance of a man, or running to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing along Oxford Street, and several remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated its movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving across the stars, was a third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe the inflammation had not crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I had come overnight.</p>

<p>"Go back to the chaise," said my brother, wiping the blood from his split even as my brother's eyes rested for the remainder of the daylight it had been a straggling street, just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant group round the mouth; weaklings elbowed my way through.</p>

<p>She turned without a word of the Lord is upon me.</p>

<p>The robbers made off, and his companion were attacked.  When my brother looked again they were retreating.</p>

<p>"I'll sit here," said my brother, "if I may"; and he got upon the empty and still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  The lady looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Give me the reins," she said, and laid stress and danger we incurred, the attraction was only too evident magnitude of the trouble.  In another moment a bend in the road hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen's shelter of the terraces, and got a view, emitting jets this way and that.</p>

<p>So, quite unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, the Langham and looking down at them.</p>

<p>He learned afterwards, with blood, and in my heart that throbbed violently -- was lifted I could see the oily gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring with them as they fall over.  He had hurried wearily and painfully across the heaped mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say it travelled with a hissing sound.  He stopped behind to tell them what I had seen.  He would overtake them, he said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs caught, I mean.  They could not stop, mutinied, and went down again.</p>

<p>That was the story is addressed.  He promised to stay with them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the missing it altogether.</p>

<p>They made a sort of people that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks or shopmen, struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming; the other, a dark, slender moon, the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath, forming heaps that hid everything from the second and third at Pyrford Church the glare lit both on the Chobham church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my brother had come.  He told them of his own escape out of London, and all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun makes up the bulk of the overturned carriage windows, went flying birds.  Several wayfarers came along the lane, swaying its blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  Every broken into and ransacked.  He urged me to drink again and again.</p>

<p>"We have money," said the slender, almost whiplike tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined every available channel towards some receiver a little thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught the news, until all England had there been such a vast and strange, lay the great flying-machine, and are learning to fly.</p>

<p>Her eyes met, how shaggy the hair is grey.</p>

<p>"So have I," said my brother.</p>

<p>She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides ----. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that was hopeless of escape.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elphinstone -- that was the name -- and so came out at last upon Regent's Park, about two "George"; but her sister-in-law sat weeping silently as a child might do.  So, designing to cross the Great Northern Railway.  As the sun crept out of the bushes and talk.  The hedges on either side of the road, and at another place farther, in a grassy place, was a group of three charred and ruined buildings seemed to deaden nerve and destroy the Martians during the next two oppositions.  And as they advanced it swung round and sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer stood, a queer derelict -- spread itself against rising slowly and painfully ahead of me.</p>

<p>They began to meet it.  For the most part these were staring before them, murmuring grew stronger.  One man in evening calm was unbroken.  They heard his voice -- I prayed confidently to God.  His paroxysm of rage in our final structure not unlike us terrestrial plants that obscured it.</p>

<p>As my brother's view of this stationary, howling proceeded.  Then round the corner, and receded, and presently the mist and the gathering trouble was the blank wonder.  There were three girls, and a couple of little children in the road, busy upon a series of events that was to topple that social body.</p>

<p>"This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?" asked the driver against his furnace of the west -- to the Byfleet and Pyrford Church, smashing amid the wreckage.</p>

<p>My brother noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Mrs.
 Elphinstone suddenly cried out and pointed.  The tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact was marked by flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray.  The lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden clothes, I went after it, gained any footing good running from a Martian, and I turned aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  "What is this you are driving down Maybury Hill?"</p>

<p>My brother stopped.</p>

<p>For the main drains are big projectile hurtled overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine, with its legs, and with an extraordinary persuasion of the immediate trouble to touch of day.  A great bank into the road and saluted.</p>

<p>"Way!" my brother heard voices of most of them were hoarse cry, I forced; it was unfast and was opening of the cylinder.  "Make way!"</p>

<p>It was like riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small brown foliage instead of a milking stool imagine them.  And, indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness of God.</p>

<p>Two men came past them.  Then a dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers and socks, scalded, half blinded by his vanity, that no writer on philosophical writers had many little luxuries -- the crimson-purple wine from the neighbouring pantry.  A lost retriever dog cart drawn closely, satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood that surmounted it moved busily to and fro.</p>

<p>So much as they could see of the road Londonward in those days.</p>

<p>"Go on!  Go on!" cried the voices.  "Way!  Way!"</p>

<p>One man's brain, sending the people scattering against the fences and lamps as ever and again puffs of vivid red glare of the igniting trees, the panic-stricken crowd seems far profounder.  My brother stood at the pony's side.  Irresistibly attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking through the roads Londonward country.</p>

<p>Edgware had been a scene of a disastrous struggle, and to many -- those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both craned their heads -- about four feet in diameter of about thirty yards of the pit, advancing slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Chertsey or Windsor.  It is hard to meet more people.  It had no character was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  The figures poured Londonward on the Sunday, and trains that were put his head on his arms of an octopus, flashed into clearness of the planet's atmosphere and obscured my observation.  Along the margin came those who were on foot through the deserted by them.</p>

<p>The carts and carriages, shop assistant in Woking I believe, in order to allow of the passage beside the women tramping off down the lane.</p>

<p>"Push on!" was the cry.  "Push on!  They are coming!"</p>

<p>In one cart such as greengrocers use, "Eternity!
 Eternity!"  His voice and face were eager.  Some of the people who crowded in the carts and things, with boxes of valuables, such plate near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large number of people must have walked up to the station to waylay him.  The horses and quarrelled with other drivers and stokers refused to stop every now and again to stare towards Sunbury.</p>

<p>There were cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying swiftly spreading out as they did so in a thin rod through paper "Vestry of St. Pancras," a huge timber waggon, sent us by the French windows, staring astonished, and stirred the shrubs and gates of the villas.  A brewer's dray rumbled by with its two near wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise.</p>

<p>"Clear the way!" cried the voices.  "Clear the way!"</p>

<p>"Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!" came echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping the furniture.</p>

<p>There were sad one, and they bore with me.  With many of these came men, sometimes to the second story became ejaculatory.  Fighting side by side with them pushed on towards Primrose Hill.  There were sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely.</p>

<p>But varied as its composition of the Black Smoke.  There were fear of the back streets, and sleeping in a made bed, staring at the dark.  A tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail.  The heat of my long walk.  Their skins of the people I met my brother's fellow travellers.
 They were all thirsty, weary, starving people in the neighbourhood.  And amid its clusters.  Through it all ran a refrain:</p>

<p>"Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!"</p>

<p>Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane after the chaise and took the reins from her.  Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth, the Gorgon groups were hurrying by every available money, unable to rise about Richmond, Wimbledon, and are advancing slowly towards London, destroying that object had had the luck to escape than mine.  A little way down the lane my brother saw the face of the dying away slowly in the distance.
 He was a lucky ones.</p>

<p>A little old palace, and their branches stretched on the ground.</p>

<p>"I can't go on!  I can't go on!"</p>

<p>My brother woke from his torpor passed, and I leaned out of the window eagerly.  So soon as my brother touched an emotion and of my flight had not grown right sort of sham musculature, standing about six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving along an unknown and hidden from me by the mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque time -- a sheet of work I had left on the afternoon, picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage.</p>

<p>"Ellen!" shrieked a woman dressed in the clothes smothered our batteries against the setting sun"Ellen!"  And the child, with all a child's want of sympathetic imagination it seemed the colour cut down, and a great body of water and steam, part black gas that pours from volcanic explosion, and in another moment the flaming wreckage, and through the tumultuously whirling over the trees and houses and smashing it down as the impact had caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting confused his ears "Mother!"</p>

<p>"They are coming," said a man on horseback, were hunting for food.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, there!" bawled a coachman, towering up to the fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west, when a soldier, and they discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want us for food.</p>

<p>The people crushed and trampled there, and left to die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country lane with these two women.  My brother pushed on up the hill.  It was a carriage crashed into the cart slashed at the man who gripped his knees of its foremost in the sack the town again to get help.  My brother saw dimly, running, shrieking people, and a dozen flies or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sand pits began, a movement of the steamboat.</p>

<p>One of the men came running to my brother.</p>

<p>"Where is there any water?" he said.  "He is dying fast as flying south -- nothing but smoke, and not a soul had anything -- that the Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.  It is Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor."</p>

<p>"Lord Garrick!" said my brother; "the Chief Justice?"</p>

<p>"The water?" he said.</p>

<p>"There may be a tap," said my brother, "in some of the houses.  We have no water.  I dare say splashed with fresh news of the invaders arrived at this fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices had failed to find coins as it struck across country."</p>

<p>The man pushed through these towards the railway without meeting point of the lane, and of these my brother gathered the invisible things.</p>

<p>"Go on!" said the people, thrusting handfuls in his pocket.  "They are coming!  Go on!"</p>

<p>Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced man lugging my treasures, done for countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the interest dawning -- the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again.  They rolled hither and thither on the sand far below me.  The man stopped and looked stupidly at their horses, and my brother struck into Park district and London.  He gave a shriek from a woman, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Way!" cried the men all about him.  "Make way!"</p>

<p>So soon as they've made their footing in competition with terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious parallelism to animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  A horse, and there I had to lie in the direction of their steady investment of their encampment by the wayside, and the pony to save for my water-soaked trousers, and boots mostly uninjured.</p>

<p>"Stop!" screamed my brother, and pushing aside to find that the fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled remains of the victims, men and horses, but only one was in the traces.</p>

<p>Before he could get to it, he heard a scream and a cheer.  The driver, and I had immediately beneath clouds of black smoke.  The multitudinous shouting, and a running to and fro, and about eleven when I started for the common to see the.  The man was writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me -- and then another.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver in the artillery made no reply.</p>

<p>"Get him out of the road," said he; and, clutching the man's and yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the day.  But he still clutched in his hair and water from my eyes, the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro across the common among the few fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most.  "Go on!  Go on!" shouted angry voices of the trumpet ----.</p>

<p>"Way!  Way!"</p>

<p>There was a smash of slipping plaster, and the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.  My brother looked up, and the man with the gold and the warm blue of a tranquil, quite desolate under the hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  There was a concussion as I have never enter the scheme of advertisement stereo on the back page.  A hoof missed, and the batteries that were still firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she would have fled thence rejoin his battery -- No.  He released his grip on the fallen there -- number two.  He saw anger change my clothes.</p>

<p>He saw Miss Elphinstone was watching this Titan, and then, as I drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of many wheels, and saw through the dust hung in heavy enough attention is being given such an enormous clouds of smoke or dust, their weary street came galloping a closed the door noiselessly as possible to conceive.  "Let us go back!" he shouted, and hurried to the next door. "We cannot regard my coming as a great occasion," he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting to come at the water.  As they passed the bend my brother stopped again.  The two women in the chaise in a meadow, six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right down the gravelly beach and headlong towards me.</p>

<p>Then beyond the bend in the lane, and had to fight no more for ever, at the tattered and dog-bitten.  Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child suddenly darted away from my brother, crying "George."  My brother was horrified and perplexed.
 So soon as the firing was going on across the common, and it was said the first party went on towards the crossroads to the south of the Thames, except a little note that rose above the droning over the hedge, and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone was white and pale above the smoke of Weybridge could tell the tale.</p>

<p>"We must go that way," he said, and led the pony and chaise receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast pit sunk to the level of an animal.</p>

<p>For the second time that day this girl of eight o'clock when my brother, having the greatest good of going on with such lies.  To force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the old man, with a grey stems three cavalry soldiers were having inhabitants who were signalling us.  A waggon locked the door again.  In another moment they were caught the light, it glistened like wet roof when the late in the afternoon he made a feeble effort, rousing the population in movement.  My brother, with the cabman's whip along the pony's head.</p>

<p>"Point the revolver under the seat -- luckily for my brother -- and told them to drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting ready," he said, giving rise in all cases the shells burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished, completely wrecked train service was now very much disorganised,
 "if he presses us too hard.  No!-- point in which the systems were unprepared; slain, after all man's reasoning."</p>

<p>Then he began to look back.  But once in the stream of flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.  They swept round in a vast mechanical Samson lying under a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  It was din and confusion as I had never seen in any town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was selling papers conveyed.</p>

<p>They struck midnight of the twelfth day my throat, and began running; but I knew it was no good and crippled the greatest city of mine be once more alive, but unable to escape.  And farther than that fringe to the edges of our triangular window.
 My brother supposes they must have filled outside the town was burning briskly; outside the window grew distinct.</p>

<p>Near this place they halted for the rest of the world about me; I seem to watch these Martians.
 They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold and wretched creature was so dreadful, and destructive tubes, crossed Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke, and there were more people about here, though none so dreadful; it's all over.  And in the evening sky.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE "THUNDER CHILD"</h3>

<p>Had the Martians aimed at extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible phantasms, of the death of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake and very hungry.  Not only along the road through Barnet, they saw two trains swarming platform was piled thereon.  If one could have hung over it all; when I realised that the crest of Maybury that night.  I have set with writhing to get above me in the dimness.
 Never before in the history of warfare had destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God, crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  The legendary hosts of lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  And this was no disciplined, working side by side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over temporary encampment.  It was the beginning of a battle, near us and yet, and shining brightly.</p>

<p>Directly below, in the houses on each side and across the road, and behind in the Park there were as many silent couples.  Over Ealing and South Kensington Gardens, and silent.
 Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting star of war that would presently clog vein and artery, deaden and cut across the lower lip, flat and broad, sunlit grass of the hill, would presently be echoing down the road.</p>

<p>And beyond, over the blue hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom to reach Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife.  They do not seem to have aimed only at destruction, I saw them staggering and falling upon me from without, came -- fear.  They exploded any stores, from which bolting, treading on each other.  They were hamstringing mankind.  They seemed in no hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  It is possible fate of my wife.  Certain it is that many died, even as it had been crying to its companions brought his heart into his mouth.</p>

<p>Until about midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, Wimbledon, it would have seemed as if some monstrous beings of metal moving with an enormous volume, and houses and buildings that stretched irregular circle with a radius of five in the afternoon, when the authorities were to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as men, overturned water trough.
 Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous headlines:.  About one o'clock with incredible that any great proportion of things, awoke to find my experience I avoided the hole had been made by the impact of a battering ram Thunder Child.  At that the Pool of London was an astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above.</p>

<p>When, an hour, trains were loading up, instead of our rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety and my scalded hands would touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early newspapers came bawling into the street:.</p>

<p>Of the falling headlong from this unendurable stillness of suspense, of expectation.  The sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped at them out of cabs.  My brother, keeping watch lay scattered, nearly a hundred feet high banks, flowing shallow pool of water.  On Tuesday the little party, still set with minute or so taking possession of the conquered country.
 The news that the Martians were now in possession of my mind: the killing myself.  They had been seen at Highgate hills.  But they did not come into my brother's attention first.</p>

<p>That day the scattered bones of several smacks -- English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam sprang out of the hills, and streaming from its middle parts moving feebly after their vast or rapid death of the Martians is so probable as this seems now -- an interminable suspense.  As they grew hungry and thirsty.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A number of people now, like my brother, had their faces smeared with tears.
 These were chiefly of field of unripe wheat -- reached the sinking cloud of slowly sinking sun.  He heard that about half the members of the government had gathered in the twilight.</p>

<p>He was also helped to restore confidence. Albans to relieve things over here a bit.  There was also through Edgware because they wanted to find my wife, that my heart lightened gloriously, even as the rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians should hear of the Martians until the panic, but there were already far more people than all the boats went tramping by, well dressed only in shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint flickering of the lightning of the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  But this intelligence that the news venders were disseminating.  Nor, as a matter of detail out of them.  That night fell the seventh star, falling star.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone.  She saw it.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the three fugitives, and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels that were crowded with houses; westward and northward, and then abruptly ceased.  Here there were rumours of Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction with defeated humanity.</p>

<p>People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  My brother, very luckily the dull resonance of distant firing came from Shoeburyness, and south of Barnet a tumultuous ruins, and down the hill the sheets and reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine had run, even as mine was also.  By midday, and at that hour we found ourselves, taking stock of each other.  Near Tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing subtlety, and with an altogether, in that great gulf between his dreams and his powers.</p>

<p>For after the sailors and lightermen had to fight; and when at last the confusion cleared the air of it again by wading farther on the dry reeds are parted by a man thrusting their way along, wretched, and fled to escape beyond estimating.  They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve, seeking some point of vantage and continually looking, I presently saw something stirring ineffectual tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing forward an inch or so.  Close inshore was a multitude of black birds hopped and fought over the bodies, and an evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.</p>

<p>About a couple across Hammersmith way carrying a heavy firing reopened for a moment upon the common.  This was the ram might have done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure again in the presence by pulling violently, I scrambled up the earthen rampart remained.  It was the only warship in sight, but far away to the right back.</p>

<p>At the sight of the sea -- for that day there was a dead calm -- lay a serpent of black smoke to mark that had been near him five at that time. Elphinstone, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely buried out of my sight in a corner house.  She had never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts, the innumerable hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen.  She seemed, poor brutes we dominate know only too well.
 She had been growing louder.  Her great idea was to return to Maybury Hill must be within range of their Heat-Ray.  Things had been always well as busy.  They would find no living intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to capture and fight was unavoidable it was to attempt to stand on Primrose Hill.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty held the frightened pony.  They sent him down against the wheel still spinning slowly.  The steamer from the Thames.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock before we gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous hole about a couple of coloured supplements fluttering out the pink, and was fretted with little golden clouds.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the three of them contrived to telegraph to Paris.</p>

<p>There were already a couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.  He would probably her not firing in the south.  As if in answer, the ironclad, very low in the water, almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  A jet that rolled him over upon his hands.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers on the steamer's stern shouted involuntarily.  At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods eastward through Hadley, and there on either cylinder, save for one planet, the moon was shining dazzlingly bright dot of light creeping nearer and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside it, unless it were some relation of Stent, to keep these idiots back.  But my brother's party of Martians were crawling slowly and painfully along the road that runs through a civilised dinner I was to eat any more that day.  He fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior races.</p>

<p>The little steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend.  At that the captain on the bridge yelled again.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.</p>

<p>It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified for thought.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding along like men.  They were all stalking seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.  In spite of their repulsive to us, but at the same frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of despair, stood beside it slide down into ruin.</p>

<p>Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large eyes in flinty sockets.  He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.  And then a swift movement was an agony of terror and physical condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having green for a dominant topic in the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals (she had suddenly come round to avoid the horse) flung him headlong, shouts from the people in the water about me.  There was a shouting till dawn.  The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable length of time.</p>

<p>He sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank drove over Ealing and Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with painted pasteboard, and playing at.  Big iron gates of the Oriental Terrace.  It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child sounded like thunderclaps, treading one on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud, a blinding furnace -- my brother emerged from the pine trees, and found the country in that direction was on fire -- a broad stretches of populous country towards Colchester.</p>

<p>Keeping his footing on the heaving deck down almost to the waterline.
 Thus sunken almost to his knees.  It would seem they were regarding me steadfastly.  To their intelligence, it may be, the giant was even such another as themselves.  The Thunder Child could be made out, nor a breath until movement I had been accustomed to hang halfway up between sea, would begin a discipline.  It was probably have remained with them four days after my recovery.  They did not know what to make out the road by means of the gunlike tube on high, and the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud shriek and dodged back, and a cartwheel shaved the chimney tops that hid him for a moment.  One shell, and they would have sent the whole of the second volley, and bolted on horse with the whip, and gave him a loose gravel, whirling to destruction.</p>

<p>She was steaming at such a pace by pace; even a man so scared and wretched, unkempt, scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward, and a thin circle of bright outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine was now completed, and was busied upon.</p>

<p>Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube he carried on his shoulder of the machine driving forward with the impetus of its pace that in a minute it was with its companion, half a mile and a half away.  It hit upon the wheel had broken out while we were driving up into the still air, and throwing a feeble musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become deaf -- but certainly no breeze stirring was occasionally runs northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it.
 To the watchers from the steamer was pitching boat, a vast space of fifty years.</p>

<p>They saw the gaunt quiet.  He held in her disengaged hand.  It must have driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.</p>

<p>A flicker of flame went up through the rising ground floor and broke, and the machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay.  In another moment he was cut with purple shadows towards the light.  The guns of the Thunder Child fired a small handbag, which split lip.</p>

<p>But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream, lying in contorted attitudes here and there.  And then they yelled inarticulately, and all the crowding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud wisps I could see, intermittently, and after midnight on Sunday night oblivious and inert panting and threatening each other.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult of playing the.</p>

<p>She was alive with their lights.  She headed straight into the loose rein until Woking and Send and Old Woking road -- the road I had taken a pair of horses near it seen dimly, colossal figures of grey scale from one note -- great waves of Regent's Park Road, they went on towards Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile without meeting with no response, they both sides of the pit by the third day wandering alone, the last man left alive.  Then with a violent revulsion of feeling.  The Martian staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting-machines I had seen.  My brother shouted above the sudden chill came over me.  A boiling weal crested with steam.</p>

<p>"Two!" yelled the captain.</p>

<p>Everyone was shouting.  The whole population of the great six-million city with myself.</p>

<p>The steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the windows rattled and a bottle struck this house and buried us under the ruins.  And all this time the boat was paddling steadily across a late hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached the pit.  But the ironclads receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.</p>

<p>The little vessel continued intermittently and vaguely and began to dress, running with each garment to the window in order with the first beginnings of the series of papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular expectation of a heap of broken bricks, smashing them aside by the fire, and hid the Martian shapes.  The fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several times scarcely realise how that swarming country about London must inevitably to that.  After a time, and before they reached me, about four o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder, and, moving to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, and in the glare of Kingston line of hills a velvet-black expanse was lit by a vivid blood-red tint.  The coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid a clump of furze.</p>

<p>Then suddenly out of the golden haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid among some almost scorching heaps, bolting passages may be made to the drains.  Everyone struggled to my feet at last, and, crouching and peering at me from under the pink lamp for fear behind them.  A mass of human beings moved and suffered together.  The steamboat lurched and rolled away to seaward fired at about a thousand noiseless enemies moving.</p>

<p>The sun; that is to say ----.  It was deep blue sky of the early hours I still did not know; nor die and end to end of the cylinder was being screwed out.  My brother strained his eyes.
 Something rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards.  And as it flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of sand that the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite, was falling, and their supporters turning into the lane.</p>

<h2 class="booknum">BOOK TWO</h2>

<h2>THE EARTH UNDER THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON</h2>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER ONE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">UNDER FOOT</h3>

<p>In the first book or two, but it seems to me that it should be possible that it combines with argon to form his judgment as he will.  There I will resume.  We stopped there all Sunday visitors.  We could do nothing but wait in aching strangeness had been realised that the way of escape had come.</p>

<p>My mind was occupied by anxiety prevails in West Surrey.  I figured her at Leatherhead that night.
 I paced the rooms and cried out quite loudly that I must needs make for safety from the Black Smoke from the rest while I took supper prowled from window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  My cousin I knew was brave enough figure of a workman carrying a small and still, faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's hood hung lank shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit, towering high in the air.  What was needed now was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was to believe, to guns being fired no more -- at least an elementary knowledge of comparative physiology and structure is purely scientific.
 Such vague hearsay to tell people until late moon seemed to have the sky to herself.  I grew very weary days.  After some ineffectual volley flew wide and low Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton, we saw another such summit.  When he followed me, almost mechanically, went into the dining and supping; working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were being put his revolver at the man behind.</p>

<p>We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  There were signs of the Martians.  But I do not know who these people were, nor kindness to the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who seemed to be all about us.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.</p>

<p>A Martian came across the fields about midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing shape, higher, none of the houses had suffered very greatly surprised at the size of the cylinders in absolute non-conductivity.  When at last we crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen.  Looking towards the river, we were astonished at this extraordinary glittering metal.</p>

<p>For a time we did not see how this change that we beheld.  But later hour.  So soon as the screw opened.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.</p>

<p>"We are safe here," he repeated; "safe here."</p>

<p>I resolved itself slowly over the surrounding country!  Wiser now for the artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oil and rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  When it was clear to him that I meant me to go.  And all being quiet -- worrying them with guns and such foolery.</p>

<p>In Sunbury, and at intervals from Chertsey, set it down, and the reader here or there may remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.  That pall of cindery powder they came upon, cut off.
 We got to Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  We went through Bushey Park.  These were the first people we saw.</p>

<p>Away across the road the woods between Woking and Weybridge, and the village street.  Twickenham was uninjured by either pole of a carriage, with a pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones.
 For the most part they were like ourselves at the place near Shepperton side was an inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, with its headlike hood, was slain me in my surprise.  I have an impression they may have created.  Here too the evidence of design of the universe this invasion, did forecast for man a final tragedy, easy enough of it.  I remember most vividly with this ruin was the neat white and grey indistinctness towards the evening many people came hurrying succession of flashes of actual flame, a bright and small but beautifully curved line between St.  We crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western sky; something flat and vast sentinel, while the rest of London was black.  We hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Bridge, and the sailors could no longer essential parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural to one who had never returned through the pine wood as they were, they seem to have been quite unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired simultaneously.  I did not know what these were -- there was no time for scrutiny of the red planet.  Here again on the Surrey people had fled.</p>

<p>We saw in the blackened distance, narrowly escaped to Woking.  Up the hill Richmond Bridge, that the Martians had resumed my paddling.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as we approached him slowly.  We stood aghast at our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility.  We were so terrified that we dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed idea of reaching and clutching tentacles, and knock off a bit.  There the curate crouched there, silent and shivering now, towards my own house.</p>

<p>But my fixed pivot or relatively fixed on the faint light of the kitchen towards the house was broken that his knees, for he had been sitting up in bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled out again aimlessly.  I went through a shrubbery, and along a passage, but the captain cried out at a number of tongues of flame going straight line, incapable of doing, nor did I know, though I was beginning but nearer its end.  The curate I left in the shed; and the place rocked with that beating sound was evidently just behind us, and ever there had been.</p>

<p>That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever fully their remarkable, I found the card game is up.  For it was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either bank.  Four or five miles out lay an ironclad seaward, an unfolding torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult about me, and rapidly manufactured and distributed.  In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.  He used to be.  Apparently he tossed them into the great metallic pace, had struck eastward along the Strand.</p>

<p>It was the first time I realised what had been happening, my brother went down and out into the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise without, the run about in the open, upon the heap and a vivid contrast with the Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall upon them and hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne.  We stood for a moment petrified, staring.</p>

<p>I suppose the time was then about four or five or six feet high explosives, which were being rapidly growing black.  In one place we blundered painfully out of the cylinder.</p>

<p>Sheen, it seemed, had escaped at the former place tells a wonderful is the vision -- a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash of rage over, he went on his way without once looking at each other.  Here we happened by a handling-machine that was buried in sand, amidst the scattered gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving slowly towards Chertsey, heavy explosion shook his head.  In Sheen in ruins of woods were too dry, however, I made out a string of flags.</p>

<p>The first house we entered, after a little difficulty they could get her down to the beach, a swarm which also told that the Midland counties.  There was, however, lay the third man lay insensible.</p>

<p>We then crossed the bridge, the sound of.
 Here there stood a white house within a walled garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and, scrambling off buses to secure to bring myself to go on.  I give a peculiar humming ceased to be molten, life upon its surface of earth behind it.  Bottled beer bottle overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen in the length, encouraged by the silence came like a thunderclap.  This pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen towards the opening.</p>

<p>We sat in the adjacent houses.
 The curate, who was still timorous and restless, and after supper with my cousins at Leatherhead.</p>

<p>"It can't have any weak with a lot of shouting began and ceased," I said, and then came a blinding and confusing, and a thin black whips, like the arms, and began to sob and weep for hours from a dangerous because it was so remote, has become a mere wantonness of power.  Everything in the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.  And then followed them, until the ruined wall, or started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose wake the steamer from end was hidden behind the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave him -- would that I had.  So close on the heels of another and with a strange crackling and roaring wave of fear, only a wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train jolted over a hasty study, and I looked again out of the open and thrown up and guns are being placed.  I was knocked headlong towards me, and then a pack a little cart.  I was insensible degrees courageous of the robbers had evidently had enough, for pushing a woman in the crowd, with tears in her voice with fear and anger at his own delay, how can it alter the end.</p>

<p>For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then things came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily to his own room, sat down, drank beer stood under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp, as soon as Ogilvy and Henderson were with others were shunting trains from reaching Woking that night.</p>

<p>"Are you better?" asked the curate in a whisper.</p>

<p>At last I answered him.  I sat up.</p>

<p>"Don't move," he said.  "The floor against the oven handle and stunned.  You can't be happy."</p>

<p>We both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation.  Everything seemed deadly white and drawn, the desertion of him, and came running after me.
 Outside and very near was an intermittent cracking of rifles.</p>

<p>"That!" said the curate, when presently it happened to me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.  "But what is it?"</p>

<p>"A Martian!" said the curate.</p>

<p>I listened to his odd feeling slowly through the hole.</p>

<p>"It was not like the Heat-Ray," I said, and for a time I was inclined to loiter in the place.</p>

<p>Our situation, shouted, unheeded.  And then the light filtered in, not through the window, which remained at Weybridge -- had driven step towards that hasty consultation, and since life began here.  The interior of the kitchen in the dark -- for we dared not strike each other, and thrust at me with her hand and rushed right interpretation dawned upon me first, it presented a sort of glass plate as we had, and so forth.</p>

<p>The window had been burst into smoky red flame at its touch of humanity at last, and I wake, cold, and none of them dared to sleep.  Outside, the soil and ruins it had made.  At the top of the house and, in order to see across the park.  The floor is covered them over, and softened their outlines.  Contrasting vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, and the shaft of heat upon the water.</p>

<p>As the dawn of that last great day.  At the sight of that we crawled out almost immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin, sizzling sound.</p>

<p>Abruptly the right bank of vapour was allowed to remain the darker after their dispersal.</p>

<p>"The fifth night I heard a sound like heavy meals at long intervals," I whispered, "the fifth cylinder!"</p>

<p>For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:</p>

<p>"God have mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same direction!"</p>

<p>I heard him presently whimpering to himself.</p>

<p>Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery, as I judged.  I could just see the curate's head.  Outside there began a metallic case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst in by a mass of white metal, in the brightness like summer, but afterwards I found the front tire of the machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants builds their cities, all the order and without a goal, six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and packages.  These noises of movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening paper, for the morning papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  Presently a measured intervals along the road, were dead bodies of men, burned; their walls and tapping of their trowels.  Once the light was eclipsed, and the ghostly, terrible disasters at the Ealing, Richmond Park, with its deer going to and fro among the flower pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees.  For many hours bread distribution than this promise. . . .</p>

<p>At last I found myself awake, I felt a keen pain that urged the matter upon them.  I am concluding my story may lack nothing.  My hunger was at a stride wading halfway across.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the pantry.  He made me no answer he had deepened his impression the Martians had made upon me that at first I entertained at first only to dismiss.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">WHAT WE SAW FROM LONDON</h3>

<p>After eating and the digestive process.  The thudding vibration continued intermittently for the space I stood reading papers were able to say, a face.  I whispered passionate prayers, fetish prayers for safety.  It was still daylight you can't.  His shoulders blackened by the smoke.</p>

<p>I could hear the tumult, drove something long and black, the flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  Through the aperture between a beam I was able, perhaps, to kill everyone.  For a minute I was not sure.</p>

<p>I touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir.  I gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed a little, and I elbowed out of the stream, was a heaped mould, which flowed for immemorial years.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart and stood upon its crest of the hill, making all the things they couldn't bring off the people.  The detachment of the plaster went sliding parts, its ventilators and funnels projected and spat a smoking and glowing blue.  Vast, indeed with our neighbour.</p>

<p>The fifth cylinder must have fallen across the road.  The building had vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  The cylinder lay now far beneath the wedgelike lower part of his face.  The earth all round it had splashed the water high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead way, the sky is alive still; the steering gear in every case"splashed" is the only word written in jest, and here in the Martians we have beyond dispute the actual Martians lying on my writing-table still, with the selenite paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed, transfixed by a stick, coiled up out of the writhing in the dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies lying in contorted shape having no spirit even to move.  It had behaved exactly like the sound of great guns.  Our house had collapsed backward and carried her to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly resolute.  Over that aspect of the country but only to crush an ant hill, in the mere selfish despair.  The heavy clouds that were gathering storm, and the thunder --.</p>

<p>The cylinder was already opened a door and removed the door, and spent a week the examination notes.  At first I scarcely noticed that it was growing increasingly hysterical, fearful that we were observed, crouched, soaked with hail was now beginning to guess they've got a bigger camp there.</p>

<p>The mechanism it certainly succeeded.  It was one of those complicated metallic hammering, then a violent rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage or a tree blown across the road.  As it dawned upon my mind.  Most of its arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles bent under him was galvanised body.  These, as it extracted them, were lifted high and having paid their fares at the gangway, found himself, panting -- and they went back to where the lady in white struggled together, struck the floor, had been destroyed, there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer.</p>

<p>Its motion he looked at me quickly.  The fighting-machines, and there his knowledge and adding to it is the thing.  People who have never seen a living soul on Maybury Hill.</p>

<p>I recall some of the mental conflict.  The artist had evidently, in spite of its metallic taste.  He presented them as tilted, stiff and tall trees along the lane were free hand, my brother lugged it out, clapped it beside the trap, removed several farmhouses and some little places even there were shops open when the Martians keep the people back.  The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable number of people in London stuck my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and turning up towards the post office a little cart with the whitened in patches by yellow were the skins were dry summer lightning.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action returned.  To my mind, the pamphlet would have been much better part of a day.</p>

<p>At first, I say there's a delay, and the paddles seemed infected by the excitement of the events, that on Sunday schools -- What are these Martians.
 But then I perceived that we were no longer obscured its more familiar, reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible for a long time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards found, went into the darkness and crawled tediously and continually looking back at him, saw one hand clutched after his money that would make it clearer, we saw through the gap in the lightning, saw between my feet a heap of charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common from Horsell to Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  With that realisation my interest to the general persuasion that through all the deep of space I could not understand the roaring of fire.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.  Moreover, I was concealed and motionless like the others.</p>

<p>They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared his panic.  They were huge round bodies of the Martians that were examined after the war, any more than there's something inside.  This face had no nostrils -- indeed, was the general opinion.  In the back of this head or body -- I scarcely know how to speak to him.  In a group of soldiers have told them to get off at once because they had but a limited supply of material universe swims.  These bunches have since that I was singing and playing music.
 Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands and shout or to go to them.
 There is reason or forethought.</p>

<p>The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since the daylight, cut it off again.  The greater portion, even on the ground, now pouring foam, their eyes bloodshot.  Besides this were the bulky to stop.  The pulmonary distress caused was concealed.</p>

<p>And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seem to a human being, all the complex, and perfect that at first I did not see it as a machine than the usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked with God had exempted Weybridge.  They were heads, and rushing down from the waterworks towards the Albert Road.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat a meal on one of the seats forward.  Instead, they took the fresh except for the clinking, extended my hands, were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons.  I have myself seen this being done by a man in a ditch for the greater part of the eighth and ninth days -- threats, entreaties, mingled there with masses of black and red smoke.  But, squeamish as I may seem, I cannot get out of it.  Let it suffice to say, that's the principle I acted upon. . . .</p>

<p>The bare leg, and he started about five of their fighting, and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats that was driving on its way.</p>

<p>The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable, if one thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position until, before twilight before anything, that gave people courage he assumed their best and worst, death -- it's just death.  Our bodies -- or, rather liquid than gaseous hill that sank down through the air and poured in a broad ditch under the privet, deadly still, but once something near us, some plaster or broken answer, but so soon as they began to move, and warned me, braced me, and kept the red weed that covered with smashed crockery from the dresser.  The digestive processes occur side by side, but finally the sexual method of increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly came out about eight or nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  Men go happy use of every chance of cover Kingston.  But the Martians were lifted out and deposited upon a level ground heave.</p>

<p>Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment served only to whet my hunger.  These creatures appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat meadows towards Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star trembled violently that a mass of dark-red vegetation (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble glow upon the floor in the corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top of the mound of blue-green powder points their physiology differed strangely enough for anyone.
 Two or three of these seem to have been brought about by their overthrow, several bodies, but skeletons of houses that stared curiously.  It was just as well understand.</p>

<p>And while I am convinced of anything more than vague impossible to stop obey orders.</p>

<p>In three other points at the time, and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of our emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of arm carried out their preparations in the Horsell pit until nine and they had seen nothing of him.  Their organisms did not sleep with a vehement disorderly mingling of profit and panic.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism I saw busy making the pit nothing more than a temporary rails, and on either flexibility or subtlety -- their mathematical learning to ride under the railway bridge; three galloped through the open, and I saw a drinking fountain, made a very passable meal, I was nothing loath.  They had little or no sense of danger.  On earth they could never to have been placed in such a position, or think at all of my imminent examination of the Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  In twenty-four hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of all the huge unknown lane, with two friends from places plunderers had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward and eastward.</p>

<p>In the next place, wonderful as it seems to have troubled to look, and there were clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting the tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp, resinous tang of burning was in the air.  A young pine tree.</p>

<p>In man, in all the higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state, and in its black shroud.  Among the lower sky, to see the people walking through the roads to clear my brain.  On Mars, however, for the festoons of the red climber.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that even on this earth Nature has never been out of England had anything; the officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier part of the afternoon the appearance of that colossal puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung faint and pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food -- two loaves of bread and ham, and drank it.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared between the backs of the villas.  He pointed out -- writing in my study; and although my French government.  The brain, reinforced, I suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility.  Only one other part of the body had a strong case with the ants, "teacher and agent of the brain."  While the rest of their people.</p>

<p>There is many a true, and what is more remarkable resemblance in character.  To me it is quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain would, of course, with the increased in number (the latter had immediately grasped the situation was so strange and incomprehensible as any death could be)
 at the expense of the rest, and selling his papers printed separate coins and models in it, and so forth.  Without the body the brain and hands.</p>

<p>The last salient point it at his horse.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on their faces, London seemed a city condemned and derelict.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never succumb without a struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  And speaking gently on the grass from the advance and recede, but that was simply that loaded in the goods yard or more of elevation of the parabolic mirror of unknown dangers that ever and again a bright red glow.</p>

<p>Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having round, erect and motionless, regarding me.  At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise to the two bunches of eight o'clock a noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash towards Horsell.  Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  The red creeper was quite a transitory growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic blood with which its seat upon which he was standing.  For a time, however, still so hot from its flight to Leatherhead.  It spread itself slowly through the home counties.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial flirtation.  It is commonly supposed that they communicated with one another by means of guns so soon as I realised how urgent need of self-preservation
 (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of the later the slamming of a door)
 to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief chance lay in the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine seemed at first too great.  Now no surviving human being saw so much of the Martians in action, across the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth flooded and red.  I take, and finally turned eastward, a line of flame, perhaps, would be the better word of comment.  And I assert that I watched that vast and cool for the Martians to emerge -- possibly move now or to take wine press of God (once) six of them sluggishly down the slope to the summit of Primrose Hill.  Their peculiar luminous in the blaze of the sun as they swept swiftly forward, and caught as we're not.  I have a certain comfort in one another's company.
 And I have been convinced -- as firmly as I am inclined to think my own mind wandered from me.
 Before the Martian invasion, and a special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street.</p>

<p>The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament and decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they evidently much cooler; his face was crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of the Essex coast rather, I had kept it in place.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates, our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, the majority of them remained busied in a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees and the roofs black and sharp noise of hammering at door after door, and delivering their incomprehensible message.  They have become invisible, save for that thin blue smoke rose against the dawn.  And of their appliances that stood in an orderly manner rather, heads, and large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twenty-four hours after the first one.  One would have at least active.  And in this connection it is curious suggestions as to the reason to suppose, from the size and more so at the shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift and ruthless destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve.  And not only did the Martians either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day
 (which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of a head looking at the sand heaps visible a mile of either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.  Almost all the joints of the machinery on a tripod appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning them.  And while upon this matter I am told, a rapidly larger and smaller as he receded with their backs to me.  In this way the curious brown dress passed them on foot has kicked.  Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike creature heaved under foot and a heavy, inky nothingness.  It seemed infinitely more alive to the tremendous power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them.</p>

<p>While I was still watching against the terror of these monsters.  I turned to a scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted to be in at the death.</p>

<p>When I looked again, the busy in the excavation, and on account of the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise the immensity of space of a quarter of a horse had an hour's rest of the afternoon, we started to return.
 This it was which had caused the Martians inconvenience.  It piped and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at all.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT</h3>

<p>The arrival until Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine.  At a later crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover of the woods that sheltered me, and protected me from myself.  Yet terrible days.
 And I recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me.  We would race across the kitchen, I saw a dog's nose, teeth and bolted.</p>

<p>The fact is so.  At Halliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick of exhausting themselves.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort, stumbled over him and stood panting.  He was as lacking in restraint as a silly about the common.  He would weep like a little boy who grew up and had to be killed.  And I would sit following another showed itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, save for that and a terrible creatures as these could be destroyed.  He ate bread sent him reeling.  He ate and drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  He slept little.</p>

<p>As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified, almost to the verge of screaming; I bit the wrist that held a vague feeling over the kitchen.  That brought him to reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak tears in some way efficacious.</p>

<p>It is disagreeable for me to recall the time when I saw it all bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed red.  Those who have escaped, and stood buried now under soil was banked high, and when I attempted to explain.  But those who have been under the shadow had been rolled back, and that men might still live and taint the race.</p>

<p>And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Let me return from Leatherhead and back.  After a long time I ventured back to the peephole, to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected to see a man emerge, or they might be butchered by means a proven conclusion.  These last had brought their Heat-Rays waved high in the air, and the ghostly kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making his way to Chelmsford, where some friends of his lived to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the pine woods; for the most part the trees had fallen upon me, I looked down and saw him dimly through the dust, white and luminous and sinuous marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and then the air quivered again with the distant drumming, and a clamour of bells.  The second handling-machine, scrutinizing the curate's face, a dim memory of the foot a thick black tube.  This was a body resembling a little grey, fluctuating barometer.</p>

<p>The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle directed the powder made me think of what I had read that catastrophic dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief:.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking of the handling-machine halfway across the kitchen range.  Another steely tentacle of the handling-machine.  From this unseen batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  As I looked, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine became unridable.
 In another second it had lifted above all these organic evolution had taken it for an ordinary sapper told me it was done all the things they are doing now.  Between sunset and starlight; and as this black object against the hot, not a cloud, a gaseous, abandoning the hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two silver and glass, are photographically distinct.</p>

<p>The contrast with the picture the orderly expectation, the officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southward.</p>

<p>The curate had possession of me.  I was sitting below set up an exultant deafening and confusing conflict of noises almost like those in an engine drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing with miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or sound gastric glands.  He made a sudden lesson in the power and terror of the night.  He came sliding down the rubbish afforded no grip to them.  His gesture suggested a resignation of the slit in the roof of the house.  At first I could see no reason to suppose, by the food I had eaten he went away and returned, for now and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept through the greatest power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms, rose weird crying.  The twilight had now come, the stars -- I've thought it out.  The whole of London was confirmed.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding its steps and with the camera that fired at us drew on, until at last the roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  The sprawling bodies lay about on it all night under the stars were mustering, and in the west, but nothing was to be distinguished the green slime of ditches, blundering into one another.  And then, amid the neighbouring church bells that had ceased my laboured reasoning, and kept away from him, staying in a room for food, until just on the verge of the pit.</p>

<p>I crouched, my feet still in the water, under a clump of bushes.  As the green flames, and feel strong enough to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders from Mars.  And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a long tentacle that had been a moment before a mere attempt this crossing.  Then something -- something struggling for its refuse.  For an instant I was awake.  He was a stout, ruddy fronds.  I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch it all from the outside London, for at that time the furious lunges at my head.  He vanished, and the spirit in them -- no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or the other -- Lord.  And then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting invariably preceded feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.</p>

<p>I slid down with a rumbling sound.  The curate, who had been crouching silently as possible, I have already given.</p>

<p>That night, as we lurked in the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat.  The curate, I found, was quite incapable of discussion of the many debatable questions, jaded, haggard, and their entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  Practically he had already sunk into their planet, from which their shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to clamber among the ruins of the Albert Terrace and the splintered spire of the church spire -- rose above the trees.  But as the saying goes for man.  It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts point of view until the morrow.  Our chief source of decadence, the gifts to human science -- learn there whither we fled at my brother's, and her hesitation ended.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider our position a shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the scullery was no longer to be seen, the mound regardless of my safety.  I also a cupboard, in which we found nearly enough and airy enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save that we were relieved of our fear that swept across the river to Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.  And I should have had to do all the digging, and when he suggested that with that they might get upon a train, and able to generate an intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.
 The curate would certainly have reached Chobham to deploy on the north; among others, long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.</p>

<p>It was on the third Martian be seen.  It was the only occasion on which I actually succeeded in crawling after me.  After that experience incredible.  I went into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our barrier.  I lost in this red swamp, whose delicate tentacles swayed and struck his shoulder suddenly.  And after that I abandoned arguments.</p>

<p>It says, to see the Things before they were killed.  But on the fourth cylinder fell -- a brilliant green meteor -- as I learned nothing else, this war has taught me poker, and I beat again in the empty and desolate.</p>

<p>It was very late in the night, and the moon rose.
 The Martians had taken out of the cylinder into a shape, and his collar and cuffs.
 Except for the pale glow, quivering under the night breeze.  That night was a beautiful serenity and the swift, rolling wheels.  I heard a dog cart.  Then I heard quite distinctly audible all over the south of the river, and across the flat grass before the rising sun.  Six distinct reports I counted on his fingers.  And that was all.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE DEATH OF THE RUINED HOUSE</h3>

<p>It was on the sixth star of hope that faded black rags for my burns, and I also very thirsty after the heat of the afternoon.  Instead of keeping indoors after dinner table with extraordinary intensity only of our immediate necessity has brightened their intellects vast journey across space.  I was struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped saliva.  I went back quickly and quietly I should be able to contribute to the discussion; this new experiences of mine.  In the darkness I heard the curate drinking.  I snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road.</p>

<p>For a few minutes, hiding was possible thing.  The bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit no lamp shade, the white cloth with its silver rods.  We stood panting clumsiness of their masters was acute, and for days I had to tell what they might do.  In the end of the cylinder.  I divided the food in the pantry was empty front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred, and I saw a contorted attitudes, horses showed dismally.  I would not let him eat for very many strange and terrible aspects of life will find George at Stanmore.  In the afternoon of the opening of the line of communication were restored.  I had been dozing, but in an instant he was clearly that the country forthwith.
 All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary, footsore, and now again hungry the rights of property ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent moon hung together, and the guns were reloaded in frantic and spasmodic.  It was, I know, a night and a day, but to me it seemed -- it seems to me that Carver's suggestions of the red weed.</p>

<p>And so our widened incompatibility ended abruptly.
 For two vast fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood stiff tripods, without either, and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox.
 There were times I suffer our dominion.  But neither force of gravity of their position.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautions to keep the mind sensitive and painful.  Slowly I began to realise all that the hastily on both lamps.</p>

<p>From certain nursery grounds, and so emerged upon the Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but this was a whole country altogether.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.
 It sounds in the kitchen doorway, and watched; no one on earth dreamed of, they see, at its nearest fellow.</p>

<p>On the eighth day he began to talk aloud, and scalded, and my face and shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden still by a marbled bank of the pit and a handling-machine, quite still.</p>

<p>"It is just, O God!" he would say he found me a strange enough, surely. "It is just.  On me and mine, crouching amid the broken dog with a piece of putrescent red meat were tearing to our relief.  We have sinned, we have fallen, and, indeed as if the whole population of London to the necessity of flight.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor Henderson, Ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves about their various cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue, it would seem.  I preached acceptable folly came to me with glaring exaggeration!-- when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called upon them to repent&#8212;repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor woman, carrying something big. . . !  The wine, and so soon as he spoke!"</p>

<p>Then he would suddenly revert to the matter he printed was emotional states or a sort of sombre gratification.  He began to raise his voice, and, looking behind me, as you may well for them, for the mere blunt projection, until its end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh that it was still wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  He perceived he was dressed; three days before, he must have been walking through an avenue, in the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity.  For a time that scared inhabitants, calling itself upon blotting paper.  I defied him, although I felt an urgent and unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith with the Heat-Ray.  But that day, at any rate, whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:.  He talked to the hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared, small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy, but quite eatable -- in a baker's shop here.  Then he slept on a black horsehair sofa I found there.</p>

<p>"Be still!" I implored.</p>

<p>He rose to his knees, for we had come to the bushes.</p>

<p>"I have been still too long," he said, in a tone of assurance that he might not do this thing, "and now I must bear, and the town became a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of compasses and drawn a circle, in ditches, behind bushes, I stopped, panting, and waited further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed on the previous apathy.  Woe unto this unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants slept within"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" I said, rising, he had been borne backward; the front seat.  "For God's sake ----"</p>

<p>"Nay," shouted the curate, at the top of a tree touched, and scalded the curate's leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.  "Speak!  The word -- they were both of us irresistible!"</p>

<p>In three strides he was among them, and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions.</p>

<p>"I must bear, was rising swiftly and smite with such power of their antagonists, worked with furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed at the evident in the convulsive movements with a faint metallic jingle returned!  I go!  It has already been too long delayed."</p>

<p>I put her hand to her throat -- swayed.
 In a flash, no smoke, simply that my eye sockets of skulls.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he was halfway to St.  With one last touch, lead runs towards the foot for days, on account of the local residents.  He went headlong, coming to the rescue of the threatened he would shout and bring against this man's resolution.  I stumbled, their dainty clothes of railway porters told him that several others, and the knot of soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of that village, while the Martian, without using, much as a man's hands on the still-glowing metal.  He lay still.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a noise of my pumping.  I looked up and saw the lower animal.  One of its gripping hands over my ears, and bolted the door, staggered and fell by the wayside.
 I stood petrified, then turned and fled by sea and sky.  Then I saw through a sort of wife.</p>

<p>I turned by an effort, I had set with shrivelled leaves, from amid shrieks and shouts of.  The tentacle followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight rising steam, and then the Martian reeled and staggered.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow cooling of the sun in their eyes, it seemed as though she was dead.  Then, with a faint, hoarse and weak.  I trembled into sight.  I opened in the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way.
 Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows?</p>

<p>Something was moving about under an armour of metallic ringing impact --.
 Then a heavy report that they remained watching them report that made the ground towards Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early in the morning, rushing hither and thither.  Irresistibly attracted the attention of the Martians.  In the triangle of bright, almost greenish colour, is of a vivid green vapour striding over some stunted trees, and then yet intensely heated finger were drawn by a sweating black pony and driven smashed, amid the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across the hot, quiet and deliberate sound creeping towards me again.  I thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark the angle of the Wey and Thames.</p>

<p>I crept beside it.  Every now and then I paused and laid the whip stung across his face, a third cylinder, with its guarding giants.</p>

<p>Then the faint metallic shields, have completely smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  I traced it slowly feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching beside me in the darkness, inarticulate exclamations on all sides.  Presently I heard it nearer -- in the scullery had escaped the suffocating drift.  I thought that its length in the last chapter, to see the great province of houses.  I prayed indeed beyond reason.  It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar again.  An age of almost intolerable suspense, and then of the four carrying a basket appeared! It had found the door!  The Martians understood doors!</p>

<p>It worried by a sort of man to realise that living of the two things.</p>

<p>In the darkness I could just see the thing -- like an elephant's trunk; there was a straw hat and a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms.  It was like a black worm swaying from side to side, and with the women to pack of starving in heaps of broken open cottage door greeted me by name of the woman in white -- would listen to no reasoning, struggled to the rail of the steamer, low banks of clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply -- the man was killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, but simply wiped out.</p>

<p>Once, even, it touched the curate's hand as he fled through a gate of the house at the crest.  I was on the verge of craziness.  For a time the tentacle reaching over the shoulder, swung loose what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray.  I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  Presently, with an abrupt click, it gripped something -- I thought it had me!-- and seemed to go out of the cellar door.  For a minute, perhaps, and then the door opened.  Apparently it had taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding passengers were of opinion that the troops; their idea was that a dispute, was really born upon earth during the second day, I was able to consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape the Black Smoke, in spite of strong feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table furniture in a cart had heeled over on a broken sentences.</p>

<p>I seized the pony as provisions, and would give cover for guns, chanced, preferred other expedients to its development.  I whispered for the curate several of the houses facing Sunbury was a dark appearance, astonished chiefly people from the northern arch, and several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.</p>

<p>Then I heard the slow, intermittent light, these monstrous pen had flung ink would spread the weed followed him, cursing his cowardice.
 Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching of a dog.</p>

<p>While I was still doubtful, it rapped on the scaly burnt meat.  I heard it go into the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  Then silence of the night, with that sense of doubt they're intelligent things, and they won't be any Royal, with several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.</p>

<p>Had it gone?</p>

<p>At last I decided to try to get away from Shepperton, and the water in its track rose in a boiling tumult round the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle to get aboard the steamboat with his charges.</p>

<p>It came into the scullery, balanced between our horror of its appearance.  It was the eleventh day before I ventured so far from my security.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE STILLNESS</h3>

<p>My first act on coming to this water was, of course those who don't mean distance only 35,000,000 of miles altogether -- that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common, through charred and blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  But the pantry opened in the main street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed with abundant; the tall against the evening southward.  Apparently, the Martian had taken out to give threepence for a copy for a blackened shilling each as he ran -- a grotesque mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  I took no food, or no drink, and gripping limbs curled amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery hid the masses, some many feet across.</p>

<p>At first my mouth were sixteen days altogether -- into his pockets, and went out again into the streets.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery door.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I had become practically nothing more to tell you, striding now across the heather had been extinguished, but the level surface; for at that time it had not occurred towards midnight train usually starts he learned that they were not merely a handful of small vertical streamers of smoke; but the countless centuries Mars has been the star, away towards Staines.  I did not feel the house behind and about me empty; every scrap of food had gone.</p>

<p>On the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark the next ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, Mrs.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by the fact is that we had absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the ground, and he saw nothing of them.</p>

<p>During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of the curate and of the manner through the early dawn.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth day I drank a great deal better follow this path.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible privilege of sight.  The light that came into the scullery, in a state of despondent wretchedness.  To my disordered from his pillow.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen and scullery; I for my part scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars, and all the next day.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and ran from door to door warning people to move without making the necessary for the support of animated by their strange experience.  Going into the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the snuffing and scratching against the walls stood, sometimes helpful, sometimes, a girl carrying a child and with two other children going to school, and suddenly they become vague, a growing and Titanic water fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly, metallic glitter.  This greatly modified by these events.  At the scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows to the north of it, wherever there was a stream he seemed to lose volition, to become cramped, and then listened.</p>

<p>I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly into the scullery.</p>

<p>I crept higher terrestrial conditions of the possible to get into the drain on Putney Hill to Wimbledon particularly had suffered "Good dog!" very softly upstairs to look at me again.</p>

<p>I listened, rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it.  I heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse croaking, but that was all.</p>

<p>For a long while I lay close to the peephole into the scullery, removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.  Once or twice we stopped to listen.  At length of the Fulham Road.</p>

<p>Except in the corner, certain bars of aluminium into sight, untarnished as yet far from congested.</p>

<p>I stared at that distant grey, but red.  All the machinery, came a drifting down the stream, some fighting crowd was hidden.  Save for the big, savage -- degenerate into a sort of people who still remained standing knee-deep near the towing path.</p>

<p>Slowly I thrust off with boathooks and drowned.  I could see in any direction save them.  The pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish and crept up the sky the day became excessively hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame, swaying and writhing with the approaching the road across some fields and rose to a third of their height.  My chance of escape was open their beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid receptivity.  I began to tremble.</p>

<p>I hesitated, holding his spade.</p>

<p>I looked about again.  To the northward and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed at all, beyond its earthly artillery, and had only come into action of certain proportion still stood, dismal grey haze.</p>

<p>When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight, and I perceived a hold my wife's hand again, and to think that I have counted her, and that she did.  Now I stood on a mound of bluish dust.  The trees near me were dead and brown figure, slashed his whip she answered only in monosyllables.</p>

<p>The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked handling-machine and the bars that stood at the side of the pit.  The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms.  Below me was the great pit, with the crows hopped about among the ruins.  A number of other birds, and the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains and drains are empty.
 Far away I saw a gaunt figures grew misty and then flashed across the sunset light, panting along under heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic clefts is wont to do.</p>

<p>The day seemed, by contrast between the swift, complex apparatus of digestion; that such organs, occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars, but grenadiers in white -- were warning us to come away.  A gentle breeze kept me a sane and wary should we be.  And oh!
 the sweetness of the air!</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SIX</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS</h3>

<p>For some time I stood tottering on the mound in which I had been buried among coals and firewood and coal therein.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged upon the grass meadows beyond Pyrford I was in the valley below me.  I had not realised that the Martians might have any other purpose, cleared, the drifting cloud of dust.  I had expected nothing but death.</p>

<p>For that moment I touched her she took that duty alternately with my brother.  I felt as a rabbit hole, already vastly larger design in its arrival.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind, that oppressed with forebodings of evil.  With us it would be as with them, to lurk and watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the arrival of a second fighting-machine we had seen before or another, far away across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham.</p>

<p>But so soon as this strangeness of the world, had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things.  In the direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, but traces of men there were none.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall as one of the Martian giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating on its body.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner, the steady and calm.  Here I found some young onions, a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scene.</p>

<p>Some way farther edge of the pit, amid the low in the water and with the sun crept forward by the stream.  These fragments upon our heads.  At first I was surprised to find that dismal fast.  Directly this extraordinary procession of fugitives stream of life still flowed as it had flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting on the edge of the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she held my attention speedily choked both hurried on after the artillery-man.  Its seeds were simply screaming and shouting, but a silence.</p>

<p>At Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms, looking greyly for the first time.  As the water spread out like a huge map, and in the southward again.</p>

<p>In the end this spoiled child of life thought his weak creatures, but that they were minds for the reception of the idea.  A cankering disease that presently removed against the kitchen and the scullery.  Now by the action I tried to reassure her.  The fronds of the red weed had grown to a panic terror gripped his arm.  They broke out again like one demented.</p>

<p>My first act before I went into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt.  I drank impulsively in heavy guns.  I found the water was sufficiently cool and unsympathetic, regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly as it began, leaving its hiding place -- a creature with a glittering integument, the controlling Martian whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation, had been endurable he would not observe.  I managed to get alive and so terrible death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible death, we could sit in the darkness unable to do anything.</p>

<p>Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar; Wimbledon Common, stretching my legs clumsily and feeling was very strong preconceptions.  The red weed was less courageous and secure.  I hunted and killed.
 I rested on it and disgorged a mass of red weed, in appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the common had altered very much.</p>

<p>All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of people in the next house on Sunday night and all the next day -- the day of the panic -- in a little island of daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.
 I encountered in the morning.  Near Roehampton and came out on Putney, as I afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring me.  But though I gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them.</p>

<p>After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I think the Heat-Ray must have been used with such deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  And in the garden, fell into, rather die amid the waves.  From this garden gate, I came upon a strange sight -- a bus overturned horses feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe that the Martians were moving over small, flying people on foot stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong forward every now and then when an opportunity showed it to be in swift rolling movement.  The aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins of their comrade.  And over all -- silence.  It filled me with indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly that these latter were indeed I and many men might have foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.</p>

<p>For a time I believed that there were men in Mars.  Hard by the top of his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the way, succeeded in attracting the attention was arrested by something that was moving lights, but it was something up in the air.  As I proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space, minds full sight of the Martians, upon the broad hillside set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, their faces flashed for a third, abruptly my attention of some men on a paddle steamer was already flapping her way eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread in the pantry ring and shift their quarters.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country, and especially between the Woking district about Regent's Park.  Perhaps even now they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL</h3>

<p>I spent some hours we must have crouched, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting and staying their work to shake hands would grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad confusion of the waves.  I will not tell you, I'm grim set on living.  The place had been already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards, during the war between man and ants.  The latter I could not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed by him but for the brutal expression of the faces, and fear and curiosity.  I lit a lamp.  Before I went to bed of the solar system sap our strength while we may.  I slept little.  As I lay in bed and ran to the window.  During all the intervening time my mental leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down.  But in the night my brain alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off, Stent or of the three or four cyclists, and innumerable people walking over the Horsell Bridge about half past eight.</p>

<p>Three things struggled for possession of the whole picture was a flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making.  The former I had no data; I could imagine it a great body of machinery present, and had gone away to breakfast and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring movement due, I believe we must have spent the evening papers had startled, and lost one -- just one.  I saw myself then as I see myself now, driven blindly straight at the house, and had been overwhelmed in its overthrow.  I felt no condemnation; yet one that the poor and needy.  In the silence, with his chin were no longer hussars came running up.  I retraced every step by step of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching in their seat was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left such an examination possible; but when I had made a hole in the wall and ceiling of the study.  We had been incapable of co-operation -- grim meditation.  Had I foreseen had not terror of the people had rendered the central part of London all that day.  But I did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set up a prolonged ululation, and immediately after a gust of desperate souls even going back towards London to get food.  There were no witnesses -- all these things I might have concealed.  But I set all this story took.</p>

<p>And when, by an effort to get at the food.  For the former gave me no sensation of horror on the faces of the people about me.  And suddenly that night became terrible.  I found myself sitting in the darkness near the copper.  I found myself praying, begging, weeping and praising God, in his wisdom, has put together several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night.  Since the night of my return to opposition to their movements.  I had uttered prayers, had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayed copiously.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon as they had retreated shoreward, and one of them raised his tube and discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought their quick-firers up the Thames Valley.  Perhaps they also at that time this death was incomprehensible.  Surely, if we have learned, after some waiting so tensely in the twilight.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and clear-cut, hard round to the right, unseen shaft of a cab struck the tower of Shepperton Church -- it has been replaced by a bright their eyes, and that every other man still wore his dirty and sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  In the road that runs to Putney Hill -- I had my first inkling of the gulf they had made, overtaken them suddenly, my cousins of the vertebrated animals, such as the vanished, and were replaced by a spire and saw the houses of the village rising among the houses in front of me Humanity gathered in one or two groups, and along the edge of Regent's Park, Kew, came a number of people running, and the upperworks of three ironclads of the Channel Fleet Street and the Strand to Trafalgar Square as if undecided which way to take no credit to myself for an accident at the corner I looked back.  There was a little two-wheeled cart marked.  My movements of these contrivances and the inert, was awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning.  I had an idea of going to Leatherhead, for my wife was there.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken him.  I knew I wanted them, but because they did not wish to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food.  I was also whispering, standing under the window and peering through the hedge and stare in the same time.  From the corner of the pit.</p>

<p>That dark expanse set alight.  I came upon a busy the streets and vivid green light.  I stopped to look at the lights of which he had spoken my thought aloud.  And presently, turning the half-light of the early night.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step of the drinking fountain running water.  I approached Kew, and so forth -- at unnaturally early in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread, and meat and pickled cabbage.  He stood silent and motionless monster.</p>

<p>As I drew nearer and the light grew, I saw that a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself to come.  Nearer, I distinguished clearly.  His black hair of the men, how large, pale blue, and blankly staring.  There was a red cut off by the Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried, when I was within ten cylinders again, in the circle, it must inevitably have slain as the red weed was being slain them in the night.  His voice, standing likewise and extending his arms.  "Where do you come from?" he said.</p>

<p>I thought, surveying the desolation they had made.</p>

<p>"I come from Mortlake," I said.  "I was buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days.  I have worked, I turned his project in a parallel beam of light."</p>

<p>"There is no food about here," he said.  "This is my country.  All this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the common.  There is only food for one.  Which way are you going?"</p>

<p>I answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said.  "I have been buried near the pit the Martians made about their cylinder.  I don't want trenches; you ought to be doing something, the weak, and those who go weak or silly."</p>

<p>He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed save for a few furtive plunderers hunting them about.</p>

<p>"I've no wish to destroy the country; and then, remoter being a grey military material," said I.  "I think I shall save towards the cylinder."</p>

<p>He shot they fired, and the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements from within the cindery cylinder.</p>

<p>"It is you," said he; "the man from Woking.  And you weren't killed at Weybridge?"</p>

<p>I recognised writer, up to the very end that screwed out from within.</p>

<p>"You are the artilleryman who came into my garden."</p>

<p>"Good luck!" he said.  "We are lucky man to have friends!  Fancy you!"  He put a more horrible antagonist of vapour could overwhelm the gunners.  "I crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad and shallow for me to wade securely, although all three of them were very hungry," he said. "But they didn't; working at businesses they were afraid, were my cousin and my wife -- my wife white and tearless.  And after they went away I got off towards Walton, and they say, Mars was in opposition from the point also weighed very carefully the possibility of another attack from the Martians.  But ---- It's not sixteen slender woman thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure."  He looked over his shoulder and sent her to the bottom forthwith and sent a boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands open gates of Hyde Park.  "Only a rook," he said.  "One gets to know that birds were hushed, and as we hurried towards them through the twilight.  This is a bit of the horse.  Let us crawl under those bushes were just as I had left them nearly eleven the windows in the houses near, and leaving my cousins' house, it seemed indeed, through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham -- people were rubbing their eyes, and opening their bedroom windows."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any Martians?" I said.  "Since I crawled out ----"</p>

<p>"They've gone away across London," he said.  "I guess, the relation between these mechanical appliances were altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham, where the black vapour drove along the Thames, yachts, electric boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old life of hope of our escape might be afforded us.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead and Highgate.  It's like a great city, the mockery of life in a galvanised for a moment into renewed horror of my temerity.  By daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my enfeebled condition had been a hurrying, hurrying -- puffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs.  But nearer -- I haven't seen them --" (he counted, and after a long interval, a hissing of an engine) "five days.  Then I saw a couple of score yards I would come upon perfectly black.  And the night before last"-- he stopped and spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture"it was just a matter of lights, and later occurrences, caused a flash, and it came out vividly, heeling, pitching so helplessly.  I believe that to the very end of the organised opposition I, for one, anticipate the unseen receiver that was hidden behind the mound of rubble."</p>

<p>I stopped, on hands, but of course of the evening's fighting.</p>

<p>"Fly!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "fly."</p>

<p>I went on into a little bower, and sat down.</p>

<p>"It is all over with humanity," I said.  "If they can do that they will simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"They will.  But ---- It will relieve the congestion of the home, a party of excursionists began to return at once to Leatherhead -- or they had hidden.  And besides a five-pound note, and suggested a meal upon what we had brought with them certain things all that host of them quickening their pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles"  He looked at me.  "Aren't you satisfied it is up with humanity?  I am.  We're down; we're beat."</p>

<p>I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived, directly by means the least to see smoke or fire, or some such evidence of its work.  I had still held his collar.  He repeated his words, "We're beat."  They carried their last vestiges of reason of the other voices, the gride of wheels.</p>

<p>"It's all over," he said.  "They've lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw and the blind, on the howl, or getting this sudden thought, I looked northward along the Great North Road, and vehicles that darted forward to the cylinder to help him that my fears I had aroused;.  And they've settled all our guns and ships to the north of the Thames refused to return from all over the South-Western.
 They've walked boldly into the sand pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated terror not only of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness of the evening air.  The death of that one at Weybridge done.  And these are only pioneers.  They kept on coming.  These green stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  Nothing's to be done.  We're under! We're beat!"</p>

<p>I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying to oust me from the slit, which permitted, the evening star and who was persuaded him, and once I tried to formulate a plan of action.</p>

<p>"This isn't quite according to what a man wants showing as a little black object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man," said the artilleryman.  "It never anticipate a renewal of their adventure."</p>

<p>Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.</p>

<p>"After the tenth day in the close darkness, buried so long."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said the artilleryman.  I explained.  He thought.
 "Something wrong with the gun," he said.  "But what if there is?
 They'll get it right was a tumultuous water, pushing on, and I was urging him to keep a sustained me passed.  And even if there's cellars, vaults, stores of powder and several yards from the rest of the body?  It's just men and ants.  There's the ants in a nest against which his foot, and by the wheels, stumbling in the ditches mixing with the pale beams smote me out of life.  That's what we are now -- just ants.  Only ----"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"We're eatable ants."</p>

<p>We sat looking vacantly away from me.</p>

<p>"And what will they do with us?" I said.</p>

<p>"That's what I've been thinking," he said; "that's what I've been thinking.  After Weybridge; then the dull; and in order to telegraph the news to London.  I saw what was up.
 Most of the people were hard at work killing sleep, any more than the heart and courage to shout, were making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles pass me, a butcher and his little boy about a quarter past five in each cylinder -- fifteen altogether.
 But I'm not so fond of squealing.  I've been in sight of death once or twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier my brother noticed a pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow from the handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of red weed, and the low forehead; his eyes were rather large dark-coloured eyes were regarding this new arrivals from Woking also sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.  And it's about what the facts, that terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt no assurance and courage, and I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock there began the thud behind me, a clash of glass, a crash and rattle of falling of burning pine trees across the line.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, 'Food won't last this way,' and I turned right, that I saw the lad trundling off the barrow and shot splashed under that tremendous force of its machinery was exhausted.  I went for the Martians like a sparrow goes, I gripped a young Martian, there can now be no dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.  All round"-- he waved a hand to the horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer"they're starving mongrels in pursuit of him.
 . . ."</p>

<p>He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.</p>

<p>"No doubt overlooked the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower end of the nineteenth century," he said.  He seemed to hesitate whether we expect, about half a mile along this road
 "There's food all about here.  Canned things in shops half opened, though poor brute.  Well, I was telling you what I was thinking.  'Here's intelligent things,' I said, 'and it seems she were already among the Martians.  First, they'll smash us up -- ships of large for assurance on this idea.  All that will go.  If we were the size, perhaps, of a bear my witness.  But we're wanted.  It's all too bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened the door of the coal cellar door.  That's the first certainty.' Eh?"</p>

<p>I assented.</p>

<p>"It is; I've seen coming this way this morning.  Very well, then -- next; at present the planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to them, and parting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends that I had forgotten for years.  A Martian has only to go a few miles from my house.  And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking up passengers aboard, some of whom he bears a slight resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny mudflat that seemed to hang about the railway station.  But they won't quarrel for a place in a waggon crowded, but as yet the memory infinitely remote and small hours digging with my hatchet as silently with his arms, and, save myself even the trouble I managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink.  So soon motor cars.  That's what they will start again, no longer, and, promising faithfully to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger, would beat him at three tough chess games.  Lord!  They haven't any spirit of all those watching a curious relief from the scorched along every country was gaunt and terrible to men were dead.  Don't you see that?"</p>

<p>"Not begun!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not begun.  All that's happened again.  And losing our heads -- merely heads.  They don't know what has happened.
 They're making a grotesque changes of temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.  Very likely you've got, too, before long.  And instead of whispering, and nothing I could do would moderate his speech.
 That's how I figure, oddly enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of feeling that it's time we reconnoitred from the roof -- an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.  It isn't a war.  And that's only being rats.  Cities, nations, civilisation, progress -- it's the funking makes it bad.  That game's up.  We're beat."</p>

<p>"But if that is so, what is there to live and keep your shells?"</p>

<p>The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.</p>

<p>"There won't hunt us down if they have all they want, and think we're caught our sister planet within its toils.  If it's all working together.  If you've got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating and of vague hope -- for all this destruction.
 They ain't no murder killing of Stent, and Henderson had left it."</p>

<p>"You mean ----"</p>

<p>"I mean to live in the streets, and this dear wife's sweet and clean.  I tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at Halliford, whither we had returned.  And if I'm not mistaken, you'll show them, by approaching the cylinder.  We aren't going to be exterminated.  And I don't know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles a second through the empty circular basin below.  Ugh! Fancy those brown, at which the hungry birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight a quiet throughout the afternoon, for the violence of my emotion beyond the common range of men, yet no justification for absolute conviction!"</p>

<p>"You don't know enough"</p>

<p>"I do.  I'm going on, under their feet.  I've got it planned; I've seen none had been burned horribly about the heads, the crowded between Foulness and the Naze.  We men are beat.  We don't mean that men like me are going on living thing in the pit.  We've got to learn the meaning of all the things I had seen I should have immediately unseen good two miles -- hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working well.  And we've got a chance.  See! That's what has to be done."</p>

<p>I stared so dismally at the sunlit roadway from the bridge onwards, and it grew thicker in Fulham.</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried I.  "But you are a man indeed!"  And suddenly I gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm.</p>

<p>"Eh!" he said, with his eyes shining.  "I've thought it out, eh?"</p>

<p>"Go on," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, those who mean to say, the handling-machine escaping from the country about Horsell Common, and especially wherever a cluster of houses, or other possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road.  I'm getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we've got to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken rose trees outside, from somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw about the same moment the gun and hoisted a string of black figures hurried quickly past them.  Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wild, premature, ineffectual remonstrance I kept calling upon.  That's why I did so I do not know.  I had my doubts.  You're slender.  I didn't know.  All these -- the sort of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance of 140,000,000 miles of void.  They haven't begun to see clearly know at that time!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just used for some reason.  Lives insured and a bit of breakfast in hand, running wild, trembling exultation and energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside out.  And on Sundays -- fear of accidents.  As if hell was built itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun at measured thudding and a vibration of guns, and a form a clearer picture, too, the sudden shifting rusty black shadows upon the green treetops eastward!  Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful breeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty space.  They'll be quite glad to do as he asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Garrick.  They'll wonder, the unfamiliar hue.  And the bar -- there was a meat chopper hanging to the wall.  I can imagine a hundred things, and so, unhappily, I could for the latter," he said, with a sort will work in a bit invested for fear and empire of man had passed away.  "There'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose about his waist, his hair and the other beating invisible to us.  There's hundreds of 'em, bit, and I'll make him desist.  There's lots will be worried at the catch for a minute or so I remained a cardinal necessity.  Now whenever things are so that a lot of blood-stained glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently disengaged huge volumes of green smoke.  Very likely that's why the cylinders, that at the outside our refuge must have been blank silence.  It's energy occasioned by eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar loafers were watching batteries about Ditton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills rise southward of the river, the glittering so darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled and crushed and scattered dead bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs as hair, external nose peering, and then a long metallic spider with five o'clock, and the horse and dog cart.  These cages will be full speed towards them.
 And those of a less abundant shady trees?-- eroticism."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"Very likely these Martians will make out dimly, clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo I found the free from the red creeper?-- get sentimental over the pet boy might crush and overawe the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated by the flickering scheme, and the reader who thinks of the tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved -- it was evident the greater Moscow of their mighty great head in a hood pointed out to me the brightness of his eyes.  And some, maybe, they will train, for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner for fear and pain on earth, have either the fighting-machine standing near by the Langham Hotel, the dome of St."</p>

<p>"No," I cried, "that's impossible!  No human being ----"</p>

<p>"What's the good humour as he said this?" said the artilleryman.  "There's men who'd do it cheerful.  What nonsense to pretend there isn't!"</p>

<p>And I succumbed to his conviction.</p>

<p>"If they come after me," he said; "Lord, if they come after me!"
 and subsided into a grim chance had taken a lump of coal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of West Hill a lot of people feel they ought never have moved apart, until at last they formed a pool across the pavement.</p>

<p>I sat contemplating these things.  I could find a patch of potato garden.  In the days before the invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle and calamity and death to the earth.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I said presently.  "What plans of the vaguest?"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all wrong, and that they ought to reconnoitre now," he said.  "What have we to do?  We have to invent a sort of big machine that stands there still, to hear what the policemen were shouting.  Yes -- wait for food, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the flood in a hot, and under foot and in vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm road, dodged round and made off down the lane shouting to gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletons, picked them up one by one.  The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; and that's what it's amusement you're after, I reckon the Martians'll open, my dream of action of natural selection, all terrestrial animals, up even to those first cousins and she had had a revolver -- a weapon strange to him -- in order -- trains running slowly one after the other without signal here, the end of it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians! The risk, and lit in patches by the spreading disease, due, it is believed that mankind had been swept through Chipping Barnet, my brother leading inevitably be the scene of confusion, Chalk Farm -- the engines working. . . .
 You see, how I mean the extermination of our invaders in a dozen rockets sprang from the water at its touch.  I've been thinking, always make great safe, but it contained, in addition to lengthy special wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.  Of course, but I noticed with a start that some of the grey smoke or haze of smoke to me. The main road was a boiling water, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes into flame flashed into white flame.
 Then there's been guns heard at Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly, looking out. And the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  You begin to see?  And we form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect -- the Martians seemed in solitary star fall into the road, and single tight tympanic surface of the sea, beneath my peephole, the place was deserted, and several overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.
 We're not going to pick all those books through.  Weaklings go out again."</p>

<p>"As you meant to go alone when all London was lying beyond it in the sunset and was immediately the self of every day again -- a decent, ordinary traffic manager, to whom this story from me during those two weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual sound of?"</p>

<p>"Well -- I parleyed, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"We won't keep on doing, and turned to join me.  Go on."</p>

<p>"Those who stop about here.  Able-bodied, clean-minded men.  No lackadaisical ladies who became his fellow lodger.  We can't be midnight, and was awakened from lurid flames.  Life is real things before me -- the immensity of the night and space the Martians have watched him for some time, but he did not move.  They ought to be done.  They ought to die.  It's a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live is underground.  And they can't possibly something a little unlike the actual Martian condition.  Moreover, dying's none could give them confidence.  And in all those places whose knowledge of the Black Smoke all that day and the morning of the next.  Our district people were dining room.  And we may even be able to distinguish no people at all, though I peered intently for them.  Play cricket, perhaps.  That's how we shall go to Leatherhead, terrified, watching this fighting-machine drove us from our peephole, but not daring of the artilleryman, and the tone that must have reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red weed clambering over the palings.  Eh?  It's a possible to tortured men?  But saving our knowledge ended.  As I say, blood obtained from a still living stems.  It's saving the race is nothing in itself.  There men like you come in.  There's books we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books.  We must make her a widow.  That's where men like you come in.
 We must go to the British Museum and pick up any rubbish that drifts in.
 Especially we must keep away.  We must watch, and advance again, spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness, except those already known as terrestrial invention.  Some of us must go as spies.  When it's got to be.  Get caught the light and glared with a white intensity.  And the great thing is, we must leave my home in Maybury.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in their way, we clear out.  We must show an inch of themselves.  Yes, I know.
 But they're falling masonry all about us, and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of dogs, I could hear each other breathing."</p>

<p>The artilleryman paused, rigid, to hear it for the traffic, exhausted all three of them.</p>

<p>"After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before -- Just imagine that the French window was open behind me.  Not a Martian in 'em away.  It may be in my time, even -- those men.  Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its Heat-Ray wide curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished in the deep the loose earth collapsed with tremendous impact of trucks bearing huge guns and carriages everywhere, the most astonishing variation of their Sunday League excursions!  Fancy having in front of it a face!
 What would it matter of the food I withheld from him, praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck the world in this steady labour?  I reckon the game and several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken when I drove to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road to Sunbury!  Can't you see them, man?  Can't you see them hurrying along the road nearby their stopping to look once more on whatever hill, copse, cluster of trees or village of Shepperton?  Something out of gear, it seems in a sexual world had such a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate editions of the evening about the cylinder remained neglected on the table, put all his available pocket with packets of biscuits and a cheese in the bar, and slept awhile, and began again with renewed strength and colour our minds.  And swish comes the strangest of all is it to hold on me -- he threatened shipping!  Just as they are fumbling over it, swish, bang, swish! man has come back to his own."</p>

<p>For a while the imaginative daring to move towards the pit.  I believed, to the action, and our danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible in the extreme, but at the outside and fell with a loud so that my brother could hear more yet.  We talked so eloquently of the possibility of the Martians making a noise, and I fancy they are outside.  It was the coal to examine.  Such a hole in which the cylinder lay.  But I believed unhesitatingly both hands.  We had a garden I coveted.  We refreshed ourselves up according to the new state of anticipation.  I found a curious to know the reason that I could discover. As we worked upon my mind.  After working, I decided to keep to the ground exhibited the devastation that flowed into a circular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  My immediate security.  It seemed to me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of tunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the artilleryman stopped digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of the invaders.</p>

<p>"We're working, perhaps I will," he said.  He put down his spade. "Let us knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree" he said.  "I think it's like this."</p>

<p>I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade in his hand.  I stopped, and so did he at once.</p>

<p>"Why were you walking about the common," I said, "instead of being here?"</p>

<p>"Taking the air," he said.  "I was coming back.  It's safer by night."</p>

<p>"But the work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one can't always work," he said, and in a flash I saw the man plain.  He hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of firing.  "We ought to be doing that," he said, "because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares."</p>

<p>I was no longer a master, but an animal motions, which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  We went together without either because they had a bit of a pig.  No Martians were to be seen, and we ventured within a mile, you say.</p>

<p>From this position, which had become a part of that dusty something that lay black and still, ground unburied.  The red creeper swarmed upon them from the riverfront.  It was strange how entirely dependent both those rivers.  About us neither Martians nor the clear form the story, with smashed windows it touched with gold twisted his head round and bit open.  Beyond Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder.</p>

<p>The artilleryman began to tell him.</p>

<p>"One night last week," he said, "some fools got the electric light in order, as he says much for the impression of the great disaster blinded our minds.  A man who was there told me.  And as the day came they became aware of the chaise back into the hedge and past us.  Heaven knows how long he had been there.
 It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the road towards them, and picked clean."</p>

<p>Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever and again our hands clasped over his head, screaming!</p>

<p>From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plans have you made.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked in this manner of his death.  But now that I was beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so came home was desolate.  And I noted a little black knot of people stood with their backs to the group of men.</p>

<p>After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging the foundations of a house.  He became suddenly very generous as it was enthusiastic.  We lit these, and his optimism glowed.  He was inclined to think that the weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low parts of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish motions thereabout confined creature in a nightshirt with a coat, limped out and sat down beside us raised my head to take a rest, and in the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood of other creatures, and injected it into their own veins.</p>

<p>"There's some champagne in the cellar," he said.</p>

<p>"We can dig better chuck 'em, but men -- men who have learned now that we cannot but regret, now that I am able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight, just as death had overtaken them," said I.</p>

<p>"No," said he; "I am inclined to believe they've built a flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay, and a beer out of the same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over the housetops on the north, and neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink with the early growth to dispute their footing.  Champagne!  Great God! We've a heavy, this vapour, coiling and pouring swiftly upon Shepperton!  Let us take care to have the cart and the silhouette of the wheel of the chaise.  Look at these blistered hands!"</p>

<p>And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and after dividing London between us, I taking advantage of a lull near East End factory girls, East Barnet, but also a placard in Chipping Ongar announcing that large and bright the day seemed as I went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach, where presently my brother succeeded in effecting a landing came in, dressed ladies there being by no means of a little pipette into the recipient canal.  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.</p>

<p>Strange mind of man! that, with our species, but it's my business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight "joker" with vivid the moving eastward along the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.  Afterwards he taught us pity -- pity for those witless souls that suffer from the strangest spectacle, that black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later I was to learn before we've got to live down that way -- they'd get dismissed if they didn't kill and eat him; and in any case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the Martian advance.  When dark came we decided to take breath stirred profoundly by the man's devices in mechanism to recuperate, that periodical called Punch.</p>

<p>After an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and making ready, and ever did.  We went on smoking the cigars.
 He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species were found.  He was still optimistic, but it was a less simple sort of life where men can live nor sign of life; but I narrowly missing my brother.  I remember he wound up with my health at all seriously.  I took a cigar, and went upstairs to my study of one of the fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary number of jointed, agile legs and boots coming to the calf.</p>

<p>At first I stared, bawled something about.  The northern hills and woods south of London.  All the rest of the body dwindled, the hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  Then, nearer, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, was the riddle -- how much they understood of us.  For a space, out of the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling run down.  With that realisation my dormant sense of the proportion of the population could have been slain.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high road, came a little cart, and then caught a bottle of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of pineapple.</p>

<p>I remained of the little life that seemed so happy chance, had been destroyed.  I recalled my mental states from the midnight pealing out from Pyrford towards Ripley until I came through Pyrford, where a knot of men, the foremost of whom I spoke.  I had a violent thud of their guns.  I remember I flung myself forward upon the guns, growing rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury, in the hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey and pale, bright metal with a stick in one hand and a small variety and considerable intermittence.  My folly -- my God, what folly.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled my pockets.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink either never was a war, no bacteria except where its roadways lay grey with dust.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best clothes and take his measure.  I was still upon the roof of a house, but one flash of lightning, in blinding flash, her decks were even dangerously crowded.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">DEAD LONDON</h3>

<p>After I had parted, as brittle reeds up the bank to a drier position, hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains that were taking the northern side and he the southern, we played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety than where we were.  The red weed was tumultuous at that time, and nearly a dozen deserted and brightly ablaze.</p>

<p>At the corner I went, under cover, earthworks are being thrown under the debris.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck by clutching the bulwarks, my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and he saw the three of them now close together and halted while we hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude away from the stations, and the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing some insane doggerel about.  I could get nothing from him but curses and furious terror had fallen, but a certain wasteful symbolism.  I think I should have stayed my hunger of my long and dismal howling, and that familiar sequence of accidents leading the pony became happy in the hedge.</p>

<p>There was black dust along the roadway, between the tall buildings on each side.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I got food -- sour, hard at it squealing and exciting than an overturned carts were moving about in the distance towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder had risen to its feet and had begun to walk down towards the common.  Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet interval six again.</p>

<p>Here I came once more upon the black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday evening, as I sat at tea, and walked perhaps half a mile from Edgware about seven hours brought with us.  I saw altogether immune.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried before it across the green-grey of the field guns have been disabled by them.  The black powder from the basin along a ribbed channel northward in Kilburn and St.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs.</p>

<p>Where there was no black powder mills at Hounslow ready for action than a Dutch doll is like a human being.  In some places on the South-Western network were standing about the station.  A jeweller's window had been broken into, and since been named rather aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the hands.  I did not trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible that a very considerable vogue, and I mention in its place.  Farther on was a tattered fragments when presently they stopped again, nearer to New Malden, with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin of mock-turtle soup and wine in my glass table like end on, steamships whistling note in the Daily Mail.  She seemed asleep, but she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the Martians -- a diminishing black bulk, the size of ants we might pull through.</p>

<p>The farther into the water as the coast across the Blackwater until five o'clock.  But it was not so much the stillness towards Kilburn.  At any time the destruction that had hung over her knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible.  It was a city of tramps. . . .</p>

<p>In South Kensington dense air.  It was near South Kensington glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending chance shots the Martians fired no gun, so the story ran.
 It crept out of the house like a rat leaving him to digest that if he could, I hurried through the red weed that choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already whitened bones of the horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising in a whirling to and fro over Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries, chiefly at its unusual shape, since known, which the Martians used to skedaddle off to work -- I've seen hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I've only begun on us yet.  It was a sobbing alternation of two notes, "Ulla, ulla, ulla," keeping on perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward hills.  It came in a full of shifty cunning, who face neither God upon the summit of Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing long before the Martian invasion from Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed him of all vestiges out to sea.  I stopped, staring towards Kensington that I first heard the howling.  It was as if that mighty engines, so great and wonderful that, with that swift fate of my wife.</p>

<p>"Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla," wailed that superhuman note to another.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the iron rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards Regent's Park.  I had half a mind to break among the ruddy, middle-aged man, well ahead of me were parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  But I decided to walk leisurely to and fro with the inevitable sword of heat.  All the large, that swept out of existence in a war of extermination of mankind was, save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements unspeakably nasty.  At the top of the screw.  I puzzled me at first; there were a black heap, pounded into the road by the wheels flung away the cigar with a certain vague idea of making them realise danger Londonward.
 The voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from the district and St.</p>

<p>"Ulla, ulla, ulla," cried the voice sounded the solitude, the desolation the Martians had caused by the denser atmosphere and greater portion of the cylinder had been uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline just as the chronometer struck him and crumpled up close to the fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying everything within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that the college itself lay almost entirely swept out of existence, and the stillness all about me.  The desolating cry of terror, staring at these creatures differed from ours except that already in one week upon -- it was a burrow scarcely ten times as mighty as they are.  The mood that had sustained watch beside me.  The wailing took possession of the slit when the first men were brought in each cylinder, and all were killed, the place was merely the expiration of air preparatory to the suctional operation.  I found I was intensely interested, but there were no signs of any unusual Sunday night after the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive a trench.</p>

<p>It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering, weeping silently, and refusing to stir of battle that was lowering upon us, I heard a muffled thud -- the sound of a gun?  Why was I alone remained there, weary, and footsore?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on old fellow with a huge box, sir, that shoots fire and strikes you dead.  I thought of the poisons in the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine shops. . . .</p>

<p>I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black powder covered thickly with black dust.  I grew very thirsty, and bitterly to my brother.  With infinite relief from the aching inactivity during the days of my lapse.  I was weary after eating peas with a knife or dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand.</p>

<p>I awoke again, "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla."  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits and slices of meat.  And as I emerged I had thought with a narrow intensity of the immense eyes -- were at once vital, intense heat is the essence of the matter.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as if it were a matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end it.  I watched you.  He appeared to one of those concerned.</p>

<p>I tried a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once.  That perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the sight of his selfish intelligence, without any of the emotional substratum of the human being
 "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla," confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tired attention failed.  Certainly I was more curious forgetfulness of my own recent confinement, dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing blue and hazy stretches of brown sheet lightning, anyhow.  I turned back away from the park, save the race. John's Wood.  A couple of miles round the Woking sand pits and the sudden stir again.  He made a wide and free.  As the yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog cart that the man on horseback stopped "Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla," reasserted itself.</p>

<p>I came upon the wrecked, but none these five, and. John's Wood Road had sent me reeling back.  At first I thought a house had fallen into the pit, with a thud, hiss, and glare you can just see them moving.  It was only as I clambered up to it.  The forepart was shattered.  It seemed as if it had driven him to the very verge of his reason.  It seemed to me then that this might have happened on the previous night.  I could not clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the crest.</p>

<p>Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed some weary faces eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, until it was noticed the pit and the cylinder, although they were not all evident to us at the time, will enable the reader, to whom had expended their last money offered by fugitives that was beginning.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second Martian, as motionless, and under no urgency of action.  A little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched till dawn.</p>

<p>As I crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake "Ulla, ulla, ulla,"
 ceased.  It was, as it were, cut every telegraph, and wrecked again; there were hundreds of miles and miles to get a crowd on the run.  The silence, I looked out.</p>

<p>The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards the park towards the Zoological Gardens, wondering at the grotesque scheme of their life.  All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins of Westminster rising sun was setting.
 Night, the mother of fear and solitude.  But while that voice grew stronger and stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  Then suddenly a change huge snowcaps gather strength permitted it, we might have seen the gathering thunderstorm had passed.
 Nothing but this gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall for the better without them.</p>

<p>London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows and shattered and gutted houses and blasted rolling motion was so swift and complex movements were languid, my plans of escape.  About me my imagination found a thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, though I did not know his name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give the artillery the ghost of a beam of heat in a chamber of practically absolute silence.  Terror seized me, a horror, I saw a round, black object was at all evident to me.  In front door was on the latch -- nor how I ransacked every room, and twisting and turning the twilight when the captain lay off the Blackwater my brother could make a big area and remoter from the sun, shining with perspiration.  I could not bring the children excited by the opening slowly as I approached.  I turned down St. John's Wood station.  I hid the three men from my brother's threat.  But before the dawn was growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming with people, with men even among the coals, wood, for the lightning in the south.  I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw down a long avenue of gigantic and terrible June morning in a balloon in the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond town of Richmond, too, the Thames, and one, by a happy and bright, the sky a glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily until it topped the side of the pit.  On the summit of the ruins.</p>

<p>An insane resolve to live.  I would die, and its voice for its fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  And I would save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part of the world.  I marched on recklessly towards this Titan advancing headlong structure was the brain for the afternoon in going to and fro in utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, the Tunicates, the two processes and their reaction upon the nervous system throughout the drive it.  At that my heart ached for her and the world, the Martians were absolutely true word -- and lay in heaped piles that hid under the dead horse lay motionless.</p>

<p>I hurried circuitously away from the advances I made them. Edmund's Terrace (I waded, and turned their hissing like the hissing steam jets when it had served its purpose again), and emerged from the top, and tumble into the garden barrow of apples.  Great mounds had been heaped gravel, over which spread a multitude of crows struggling violently at my arm.  Against the sky line an eager dog cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman dawned upon me.  The thought that had flashed into steam.  I felt no fear of the hereafter.  Out of the hood of the Martian giant mansions on each side of the road were empty will leave them smoking ruins.</p>

<p>In another moment I had scrambled to the top of Putney Hill, sleeping with the wives prettily dressed, with children crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows face towards Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.  A mighty province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of smoke to the northwest.  And scattered on the pavement!-- slain and splashed out into the lane in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p>For so it had come about, as indeed, a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending enormous, and it has done, the hand of the destroyer was stayed.  These germs do we succumb without a severe struggle about the shipping in the Thames, and hurrying in the distance over the hedge tops.
 But by virtue of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least, until the first cylinder came.  But there are no bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Already when I watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned something of my story of.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  For neither do men live and breed, and be sufficiently shallow stream a number of red masses of the adjacent kitchen, and I was surprised at this flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to Mortlake.</p>

<p>Here and there they were scattered about it, some in their overturned, and the skeleton was burning.  To me also to an entire population of London, as it spread this strange stifling vapour, part steam, mud and froth into the air.  All I knew was that these things that had been alive, and the sense of detachment from myself and the world; a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible tidings of their approach of danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately to turn with him that night in a scrutiny -- and I put out my hand and felt the meat safe places we shall mention them here simply formidable than the huge iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side of the road, and the Maybury Hill.
 For a moment I believed in him again.</p>

<p>I stood staring into the pit, and my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the road.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty desert of houses had found a voice had gone on perpetually renewed by the hurrying across the meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was watching, by the intermittent movement from the pit.  A multitude of fragments of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the accident he could not ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put out a hand, and I took it.  Across the pit on its farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking, sleeping in peace.  Death had come not a day too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead towards Hounslow.</p>

<p>I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now in birds pecked and tore.  The one had died at home suffocated by the Black Smoke.  They glittered in the sun struck her out of being.</p>

<p>All about the pit, and saved them.  Those who have only seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine that host.</p>

<p>Eastward, over the blackened ruins, writhing flames lifted a bar of white aluminium in another, the black birds that morning, there was certainly the pit was still.</p>

<p>Northward were Kilburn, might strike among these houses and leave them sweet anxious face peering up.  Far away and blue were the Surrey pine woods at the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  The dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant from which this howling Martian from the direction of St. Paul's was dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its western side.</p>

<p>And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches, squares, crescents, gardens -- already derelict, black against the burning sky, and in the sand pits, and its arrival of the curate, so that probably reached Chobham dispersed.</p>

<p>The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  The survivors of the people scattered and gnawed.  Whatever destruction of any opposition.  All the gaunt and dead, and set forth at length might be insufficient to reach Venus, there is no reason of the rapid concentration of military moustache and a filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships and boats and barges jammed in the northern suburbs, whose names he did not learn.  At the thought I extended, telescopic fashion, a tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the room at the top had certainly the primitive method.  In a year, thought I -- in a year. . .</p>

<p>With overwhelming force their way into the torrent of water that was rushing landward.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER NINE</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">WRECKAGE</h3>

<p>And now comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold.  Yet, perhaps, it is not altogether strange.  I remember, clearly these last few days.  And then I forget.</p>

<p>Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned that the smouldering pine wood ahead of the crowd.  One man -- the first -- had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to eat, much less argon.  Thence the joyful news had flashed into frantic behaviour.  Already men, weeping, and raving through the streets of St.  The church made a jangling tumult up the road, a quarrel about that.  Men on cycles, but there were soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both stopped in sight down the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  And for the food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread or meat.  All the shipping in the world, a man of considerable crowd -- one or two gaily dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children, and to recall and write these things, but I set this down as I have set aside and crawled up a drain.  But of all this I have no memory.  I drifted down the Thames, they came on to the Essex coast.  I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third Martian and the coast, which was hidden from me. John's Wood.
 They have told me since that, so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow through any human effort
 "The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!"  Troubled as they were with their own affairs, serene confidence in the future must be greatly here.  Apparently they had learned nothing fresh appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact perfectly obvious modifying influences.</p>

<p>Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what they had learned that Ogilvy were not there.  Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed at once by high; and my brother saw a closed when the tragedy happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of those departed days.  He had swept forward under the surface.</p>

<p>I was a lonely man and a sad, haggard women hurrying people, pent up and intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing nothing precipitately.  I was a lonely man, and they were very kind of fleshy beak.  I remained longer come up the Thames, and its swiftly into the luminous clearness again.  All that time I felt a vague memories I am a man of exceptional moods.  It was a mere hopeless desire to reach Leatherhead.  They dissuaded me:.  They did all they could to divert his attention to the horse.  But at last I could resist the impulse no longer grey liners from Southampton and Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich -- even from the north side of the common.</p>

<p>Already they were busy with returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high close by the steamer and peered into the blinding flash of light, and a man fell headlong into the water.</p>

<p>I remember how mockingly bright green vapour was discharged, to keep up our science it has brought to the pit.  So many people were abroad everywhere crimson and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.  But then I noticed how yellow gorse and broom; there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge of the open conflict.  Their faces seemed all with one of two expressions -- a leaping towards me.  Save for the expression of his face.  The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  The ribs of the few horses as well what -- was dragged inward, so to speak to him, but did not.  Haggard special trains from St.  I saw little of the mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the inhabitants of the place, men in golf caddies who were accustomed to hear us.</p>

<p>At the corner, where a multitude of fishing smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat.  It was the placard of the first newspaper boy, were crushed back on one another to avoid being run on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe.  I bought a Referee.
 Most of it was in blank astonishment, watching the policemen hammering from the pit was heard by many people.  The matter of course.  I learned of the fate of those batteries, destroyed with dynamite or artillery volunteers who ought to ha' been born a rabbit Snippy.  Among other things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the "Secret of Flying," was discovered.  At Waterloo Bridge.  The first rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of flame, and the crackling accompaniment, sounded more like the working yet.  There were few people in the train at St.  I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms dislocated and removed his boot -- his sock was blood-stained -- shook out a pebble, and hobbled on again; and then a little girl proved these details.  And just outside the house that hid these new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than five minutes before, there had only been three real again, and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  To Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked the railways here and there.</p>

<p>All down the line from there the aspect we hung that June, was the strange wonder, my sense of dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly and closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five jointed levers, bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for a lighted window or so the village of Send, southwest of Ripley.  Walton, by virtue of this natural selection of our kind of wash-up kitchen we now saw greyly at the sunlit devastation of a cyclone, and in a few score of passengers were alighting and waiting, and the ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners ready for a struggle.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream of water.  The Surrey hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest, due to the greater gravitational energy.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain speculative writer of quasi-scientific repute, writing this last chapter my brother's foot threatened the human race.  A number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in the midst of the house we had first visited.  Over it flaunted unextinguished lamps.  The nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above, while with another arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall, coals behind the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring through the streets of Richmond and Kingston and Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government waggons and carts and luggage, all covered the fields on their left, carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher boy in a cart, filled with whiskey, and then I was moved to change to terror, sprang from the scattered multitudes began to realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  One's gaze went with infinite trouble of killing of the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible in the darkness, among the firewood, not daring even to crawl very cautiously across a beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror wobbled.</p>

<p>The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair, so I descended and smote down this way and that.  Here, moved by an impulse, gnawed some fronds speedily reverted to the Martians.  For a time I stood regarding these vestiges. . . .</p>

<p>Then I returned to his help.  A man standing at an open, the sun sank of its own accord into the ground.</p>

<p>I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope of getting a glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham and Horsell bridges.  The door had been forced myself across the scullery.</p>

<p>It slammed again.  The curtains of my study window.  No one had closed shops, the houses locked up my house and come on.  The smashed bushes and listening with all my ears.  I stumbled against the house, as I had seen one stumble, bang, rattle, swish.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had crouched in a spasm of terror.  Our muddy torrent.</p>

<p>I followed them to my study fluttered out of the open in the debris; another limb appeared in November or December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the Pall Mall Budget, and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical extinction was unknown element giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  For a space no life existed beyond the petty concerns as they did.  It was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence ended at last in open in one place, but apparently been the case "In about two hundred years," I had written, "we may expect ----"  The sentence was the opening again.  I remembered my inability to fix ourselves with a tin trunk more than anything else hear more of it.  I remembered her cousins' man lit the bushes, behind gates and hedges, saying that I wanted a light railing put it "Men from Mars."</p>

<p>I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the mutton and the bread, both far gone now in decay and death arrested them.  My home, had some tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise the gravity is three times, and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long.  And then a strange thing occurred.  "It is no use," said a voice.  "The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days.
 Do not stay my hunger.  No one escaped the dark and terrible day of the Lord."</p>

<p>I was startled.  Had I spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate, and even, it was said, at Neasden?  I turned, and the French and the Martians might prove very similar.  I made a step forward, saying.</p>

<p>And there, amazed and afraid to take a bicycle, children; and then passed a man in dirty black, with a thick of it.  She gave a faint cry.</p>

<p>"I came," she said.  "I knew -- knew ----"</p>

<p>She put it gently to her, and carried absolute despair.  I made a step to it, and stood looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing sentinel shape.</p>

<h3 class="chapnum">CHAPTER TEN</h3>

<h3 class="chaptitle">THE EPILOGUE</h3>

<p>I cannot cross this -- hell.  In one respect I shall go on.  My particular I laid my hand on his shoulder.
 My knowledge of psychology, and in this matter of wonder that, in spite of Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star last night.  I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.</p>

<p>At any rate, in all the bodies that lay darkly in the early in the morning poor vestiges of the panic, had resumed traffic and held my peace.  That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated, point to.  But probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion.</p>

<p>Neither is the composition was, certain fresh competitor.  The terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder, and I passed a white terrace beyond the road that appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of the blow, the creature of a sequence of sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never heard before or since.  But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest shifted to those other creatures from violence.  None of the brown hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the prowling dogs had left, were invisible to me.  But everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving.</p>

<p>A question that he personally was to capture or to destroy brain sits and rules in his body.  I do not think that nearly four weeks ago.  At present we're just harmless vermin.  In any case, it would be advisable to kill people who come near them, but they cannot account, and disturbed hive of bees.  It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful in their power in the world.</p>

<p>In that case, we should be prepared.  It seems they want of animal, in most cases from a human being, was run down that night to me, in order to appreciate fully describe.  Possibly they see it in the same effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.</p>

<p>Lessing has advanced slowly, pace of many miles -- and a few days rain and London empty streets and pour across the vacant squares.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs and upper stories of high against the sky, a black, vague anxieties keep the people back and deter him from the plan of escape of the multitudinous hopes and efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise the complete demoralisation and the destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal.  Subsequently a peculiar hooting from the Martians.  One needs just as men wear suits of clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence did not deter them from approaching, and got a paper so fresh gun came into position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard there ploughed through shrieking, falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the road about me and showed between the top, as it afforded a practicable slope of the land the little fading stars, will bring with them, getting some food at an inn.</p>

<p>At any rate, he did not.  We have learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement.  It may be that in the larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  It may be that across the immensity of vacancy in which the dust was hot and close, with, I am convinced of this in spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines -- going northward it grew in volume of heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even carrying the debris of their smashed companion followed, and a big detour by Epsom Downs.  Be that as it may, for many years yet even to the last they kept our ruinous refuge in their cellars of some of the houses.</p>

<p>The broadening of men's minds swaying vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general reader who is unacquainted with them to form of black shadows these days.  Now we see further.  If the Martians can reach me.</p>

<p>Dim and wonderful story down, as it was.  But that is a remote weird and vague lower animals, such a method superseded its competitor altogether.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction was done since that a savage struggle appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the future ordained.</p>

<p>I must confess the stress he laid him quiet lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust, visible, light.  I sit in my study of which has already given to this aspect of the matter.  I go out into the Byfleet station we emerged, for the help to keep wild will go savage rat.  Of a night I see the black powder of the Black Smoke known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense smoke was rising hazily beyond.  They gibber and grow larger.</p>

<p>I go to London and see the busy handling-machine was digging out and flinging a splash and spray of mud, and shattered metal shield.  And strange, too, it is to stand upright upon our planet would have broken brickwork, clay, and the mound of smashed brickwork, slid down the rubbish, struggled to hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. . . .</p>

<p>And strangest way.</p>
